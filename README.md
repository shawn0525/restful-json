    "description" : "Amesos is the Direct Sparse Solver Package in Trilinos. The goal of Amesos is to make AX=S as easy as it sounds, at least for direct methods. Amesos provides interfaces to a number of third party sparse direct solvers, including SuperLU, SuperLU MPI, DSCPACK, UMFPACK and KLU. Amesos provides a common object oriented interface to the best sparse direct solvers in the world. A sparse direct solver solves for x in Ax = b. where A is a matrix and x and b are vectors (or multi-vectors). A sparse direct solver flrst factors A into trinagular matrices L and U such that A = LU via gaussian elimination and then solves LU x = b. Switching amongst solvers in Amesos roquires a change to a single parameter. Yet, no solver needs to be linked it, unless it is used. All conversions between the matrices provided by the user and the format required by the underlying solver is performed by Amesos. As new sparse direct solvers are created, they will be incorporated into Amesos, allowing the user to simpty link with the new solver, change a single parameter in the calling sequence, and use the new solver. Amesos allows users to specify whether the matrix has changed. Amesos can be used anywhere that any sparse direct solver is needed.",

Motar methods are a type of Lagrange Multiplier constraints that can be used in contact formulations and in non-conforming or conforming mesh typing as well as in domain decomposition techniques. Suitable conditions at interfaces are formulated as weak continuity conditions in dual variables introducing Lagrange multiplers on the interface. By an appropriate choice of the function space of the Lagrange multipliers on an interface it is possible to locally condense Lagrange multipliers such that a sparse and definite system of equations can be formed which is equalivalent to the saddle point system resulting from the Lagrange multiplier formulation.",

More specifically the code solves the integral equations of a particular class of liquid state theory namely density functional theories (DFT) of inhomogeneous fluids in order to predict the structure and thermodynamic properties of fluids near surfaces, in porous media, or near macromolecules. It can also be used to study self-assembling systems such as lamellae forming diblock copolymers or lipid bilayers. The types of fluids currently treated by the code include atomistic fluids (hard spheres, Lennard-Jones, ions, etc), freely-jointed polymers, and small molecules with bond constraints. The system of equations solved by this code are integral equations of finite range. They lead to sparse matrices for large physical systems, but rather dense matrices when the physical systems are small. The systems of equations are solved using a real space matrix based Newton's method. Standard freely available parallel iterative solvers many be used to solve the problem (see Aztecoo from Sandia's Trilinos project). Alternatively, specialized Schur complement based solvers developed for more efficient solution of these semi-dense matrices may be used.",

Although it does not address many performance issues present in real engineering applications, such as load imbalance and preconditioner scalability, it can serve as a first \"sanity test\" of new processor design choices, inter-connect network design choices and the scalability of a new computer system. Because it is self-contained, easy to compile and easily scaled to 100s or 1000s of porcessors, it can be an attractive study code for computer system designers.",

The goal behind its creation is to learn to control robots in unfamiliar environments in a way that is very robust, similar to the way that an infant learns to interact with her environment by trial and error. As of this release, this software contains two simulations of BECCA controlling robots: one is a one degree-of-freedom spinner robot and the other is a 7 degree-of-freedom serial link arm with a terminal gripper. In addition, the software contains code that identifies synonyms in a untagged corpus of ASCII words. This last is a demonstration of BECCA's ability to generate abstract concepts from concrete experience. The BECCA simulation is coded so as to make it extensible to new applications. It is modular, object-oriented code in which the portions of the code that are specific to one simulation are easily separable from those portions that are the constant between implementations. BECCA makes very few assumptions about the robot and environment it is learning, and so is applicable to a wide range of learning and control problems.",

As a cluster resource manager, SLURM has three key functions. First, it allocates exclusive and/or non exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allciated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates conflicting requests for resouces by managing a queue of pending work.",

    "description" : "The Scalable Checkpoint/Restart (SCR) library provides an interface that codes may use to worite our and read in application-level checkpoints in a scalable fashion. In the current implementation, checkpoint files are cached in local storage (hard disk or RAM disk) on the compute nodes. This technique provides scalable aggregate bandwidth and uses storage resources that are fully dedicated to the job. This approach addresses the two common drawbacks of checkpointing a large-scale application to a shared parallel file system, namely, limited bandwidth and file system contention. In fact, on current platforms, SCR scales linearly with the number of compute nodes. It has been benchmarked as high as 720GB/s on 1094 nodes of Atlas, which is nearly two orders of magnitude faster thanthe parallel file system.",

The advantages of this algorithm over traditional finite difference-based simulators are: (1) it is much more accurate; (2) it can handle widely disparate time scales, ranging from sub-seconds to many years; and 3) it is easy to integrate with new modules and third-party systems. The advantage over traditional differential-based solvers is that it is not necessary to integrate all the device's behaviors into a single set of equations that must be solved.",

Features include pathlines of analysis variables drawn on the mesh, element selection by material, element birth and death, multiple views combining several displays on each plot, symmetry mirroring, and node and element numbering. X-Y plots of the analysis variables include time vs. variable plots or variable vs. variable plots, and distance vs. variable plots at selected time steps where distance is the accumulated distance between pairs of nodes or element centers. BLOT is written in as portable a form as possible. Fortran code is written in ANSI Standard FORTRAN-77. Machine-specific routines are limited in number and are grouped together to minimize the time required to adapt them to a new system. SEACAS codes have been ported to several Unix systems",

    "description" : "Memory size has long limited large-scale applications on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Increasing core counts per chip and power density constraints, which limit the number of DIMMs per node, have exacerbated this problem. Mechanisms to manage memory usage - preferably transparently - more efficiently could increase effective DRAM capacity and, thus, the benefit of multicore similarity. These data regions occupy multiple physical locations within a multicore node and thus offer a potential savings in memory capacity. These data, primarily residing in heap, are quite dynamic, which makes them difficult to manage statically. SBLLmalloc is a memory allocation library that automatically identifies the replicated memory blocks and merges them into a single copy. SBLLmalloc does not require application or OS changes since we implement it as a user-level library that can be linked at runtime. SBLLmalloc provides the capability to run larger problems using the same hardware configuration in multicore nodes. SBLLmalloc has been implemented for Linux clusters.",

The first application of this model has been for modeling the performance of thermal batteries. However, an implementation for secondary ion batteries is next. CanTrilBat applications solves transient problems involving batteries. It is a 1-D application that represents 3-D physical systems that can be reduced using the porous flow approximation for the anode, cathode, and separator. A control volume formulation is used to track conserved quantities. An operator-split approach is used to calculate the chemistry, diffusion and electronic transport that occurs within cathode and anode particles, allowing for the reduction in code complexity.",

Albany is a research code that demonstrates how a PDE code can be built by interfacing many of the open-source software libraries that are released under Sandia's Trilinos project. Part of the mission of Albany is to be a testbed for new Trilinos libraries, to refine their methods, usability, and interfaces. Albany also serves as a demonstration code on how to build an application code against an installed Trilinos project. Because of this, Albany is a desirable starting point for new code development efforts that wish to make heavy use of Trilinos. The physics solved in Albany are currently only very academic problems, such as heat transfer, linear elasticity, and nonlinear elasticity. Albany includes hooks to optimization and uncertainty quantification algorithms, including those in the Dakota toolkit.",

    "description" : "PECOS is a computational library for creating and manipulating realizations of stochastic quantities, including scalar uncertain variables, random fields, and stochastic processes. It offers a unified interface to univariate and multivariate polynomial approximations using either orthogonal or interpolation polynomials; numerical integration drivers for Latin hypercube sampling, quadrature, cubature, and sparse grids; and fast Fourier transforms using third party libraries. The PECOS core also offers statistical utilities and transformations between various representations of stochastic uncertainty. PECOS provides a C++ API through which users can generate and transform realizations of stochastic quantities. It is currently used by Sandia's DAKOTA, Stokhos, and Encore software packages for uncertainty quantification and verification. PECOS generates random sample sets and multi-dimensional integration grids, typically used in forward propagation of scalar uncertainty in computational models (uncertainty quantification (UQ)). PECOS also generates samples of random fields (RFs) and stochastic processes (SPs) from a set of user-defined power spectral densities (PSDs). The RF/SP may be either Gaussian or non-Gaussian and either stationary or nonstationary, and the resulting sample is intended for run-time query by parallel finite element simulation codes. Finally, PECOS supports nonlinear transformations of random variables via the Nataf transformation and extensions.",

The Image Composition Engine for Tiles (lceT) is a high-performance sort-last parallel rendering library. IceT uses a \"sort-Iasf' approach to rendering. Each process in a parallel application independently renders a local piece of geometry. The resulting images are given to IceT, and IceT combines the images together to form a single cohesive image. Ice T is also capable of driving tiled displays, largeformat displays comprising an array of smaller displays. To this end IceT can collect the smaller tile images and organize them such that the entire tiled display can be driven. Ice T takes advantage of spatial coherence in geometry by identifying empty regions of the display and reducing the overall required work.",

To meet this need, Sandia has developed a PV performance modeling toolbox (PV_LIB) for Matlab. It contains a set of well-documented, open source functions and example scripts showing the functions being used in practical examples. This toolbox is meant to help make the multi-step process of modeling a PV system more transparent and provide the means for model users to validate and understand the models they use and or develop. It is fully integrated into Matlab's help and documentation utilities. The PV_LIB Toolbox provides more than 30 functions that are sorted into four categories",

Frequency-domain near-field methods are used for the SR calculation, and the Fourier-optics based approach is generally used for the wavefront propagation simulation. The code enables both fully- and partially-coherent radiation propagation simulations in steady-state and in frequency-/time-dependent regimes. With these features, the code has already proven its utility for a large number of applications in infrared, UV, soft and hard X-ray spectral range, in such important areas as analysis of spectral performances of new synchrotron radiation sources, optimization of user beamlines, development of new optical elements, source and beamline diagnostics, and even complete simulation of SR based experiments. Besides the SR applications, the code can be efficiently used for various simulations involving conventional lasers and other sources. SRW versions interfaced to Python and to IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics), as well as cross-platform library with C API, are available.",

    "description" : "Many new, high-performance nuclear energy modeling and simulation tools are under development in the United States and many more existing projects are moving to high-performance computing. This shift to state-of-the-art modeling and simulation will not only result in an unprecedented use of computing resources but it will generate extremely large amounts of data in extraordinary detail. Domain scientists will find themselves simultaneously in two positions: managing the complexity of their own problem domain and managing the complexity of a nightmarish scenario of high-performance computational tools. We believe that the computational science community should develop integrated tools for coupling, working with and analyzing data from simulation codes instead of leaving domains scientists and students to fend for themselves and come up with a \"working\" solution. While many projects offer some set of tools to work with their codes, to launch jobs remotely or to setup input files, most of these tools are rarely integrated in a holistic way to provide an easy, common and high-productivity environment for users. For that matter, most remote jobs are launched on \"the machine in the other room,\" but that certainly will not work for larger problems that require Leadership Class computing resources found only at U.S. National Laboratories or similar facilities. Overcoming the challenges of launching on these machines and even on public or private \"clouds\" are left as a challenge to the user.",

SW4 supports a fully 3-D heterogeneous material model that can be specified in several formats. SW4 can output synthetic seismograms in an ASCII test format, or in the SAC finary format. It can also present simulation information as GMT scripts, whixh can be used to create annotated maps. Furthermore, SW4 can output the solution as well as the material model along 2-D grid planes.",

    "description" : "This particular consortium implementation of the software integration infrastructure will, in large part, refactor portions of the Rocstar multiphysics infrastructure. Development of this infrastructure originated at the University of Illinois DOE ASCI Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets (CSAR) to support the center's massively parallel multiphysics simulation application, Rocstar, and has continued at IllinoisRocstar, a small company formed near the end of the University-based program. IllinoisRocstar is now licensing these new developments as free, open source, in hopes to help improve their own and others' access to infrastructure which can be readily utilized in developing coupled or composite software systems; with particular attention to more rapid production and utilization of multiphysics applications in the HPC environment. There are two major pieces to the consortium implementation, the Application Component Toolkit (ACT), and the Multiphysics Application Coupling Toolkit (MPACT). The current development focus is the ACT, which is (will be) the substrate for MPACT. The ACT itself is built up from the components described in the technical approach. In particular, the ACT has the following major components: 1.The Component Object Manager (COM): The COM package provides encapsulation of user applications, and their data. COM also provides the inter-component function call mechanism. 2.The System Integration Manager (SIM): The SIM package provides constructs and mechanisms for orchestrating composite systems of multiply integrated pieces.",

MOOSE, like other tools, doesn't actually complete a task. Instead, MOOSE seeks to reduce the effort required to create engineering simulation applications. MOOSE itself is a software library: a blank canvas upon which you write equations and then MOOSE can help you solve them. MOOSE is comparable to a spreadsheet application. A spreadsheet, by itself, doesn't do anything. Only once equations are entered into it will a spreadsheet application compute anything. Such is the same for MOOSE. An engineer or scientist can utilize the equation solvers within MOOSE to solve equations related to their area of study. For instance, a geomechanical scientist can input equations related to water flow in underground reservoirs and MOOSE can solve those equations to give the scientist an idea of how water could move over time. An engineer might input equations related to the forces in steel beams in order to understand the load bearing capacity of a bridge. Because MOOSE is a blank canvas it can be useful in many scientific and engineering pursuits.",

GOSS enables Department of Energy, power system utilities, and vendors to build better tools faster. GOSS makes it possible to integrate Future Power Grid Initiative software products/prototypes into existing power grid software systems, including the PNNL PowerNet and EIOC environments. GOSS is designed to allow power grid applications developed for different underlying software platforms installed in different utilities to communicate with ease. This can be done in compliance with existing security and data sharing policies between the utilities. GOSS not only supports one-to-one data transfer between applications, but also publisher/subscriber scheme. To support interoperability requirements of future EMS, GOSS is designed for CIM compliance. In addition to this, it supports authentication and authorization capabilities to protect the system from cyber threats. In summary, the contributions of the GOSS middleware are as follows: A platform to support future EMS development. A middleware that promotes interoperability between power grid applications. A distributed architecture that separates data sources from power grid applications. Support for data exchange with either one-to-one or publisher/subscriber interfaces. An authentication and authorization scheme for limiting the access to data between utilities.",

Several techniques are proposed for improved speed and memory space usage including adaptive and aggressive elimination of samples for faster convergence , and sparse format representation of data samples. Several heuristics for earliest possible to lazy elimination of non-contributing samples are considered in MaTEx. In many cases, where an early sample elimination might result in a false positive, low overhead mechanisms for reconstruction of key data structures are proposed. The proposed algorithm and heuristics are implemented and evaluated on various publicly available datasets",

    "description" : "UPC++ is a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) extension for C++, with three main objectives: 1) to provide an object-oriented PGAS programming model in the context of the popular C++ language; 2) to add useful parallel programming idioms unavailable in UPC, such as asynchronous remote function invocation and multidimensional arrays, to support complex scientific applications; 3) to offer an easy on-ramp to PGAS programming through interoperability with other existing parallel programming systems (e.g., MPI, OpenMP, CUDA). UPC++ includes two main features beyond UPC: 1) One of the major limitations of UPC in the context of DOE application is the relatively weak notion of multidimensional arrays, which it inherited from C. To remedy this problem in UPC++, we included a multidimensional domain and array library based on that of Titanium. Titanium's library is similar to Chapel's dense and strided domains, as both were inspired by the dense and strided regions and arrays in ZPL. 2) Another feature provided by UPC++ but not by UPC is remote function invocation, which is inspired by Phalanx, X10, Habanero-C, and C++11. The user may start an asynchronous remote function invocation with the following syntax: \"async(place)(function, args...);\". UPC++ provides two programming constructs for specifying dynamic dependencies among tasks: 1) event-driven execution as in Phalanx and Habanero-C; 2) finish-async as in X10. We implemented UPC++ with a \"compiler-free\" approach using C++ templates and runtime libraries. The UPC++ front-end consists of a set of C++ header files that enables the C++ compiler to \"translate\" UPC++ features in a user program to runtime library calls. In particular, we use templates and operator overloading to customize the behavior of UPC++ types.\n\nThis software package has been replaced with UPCC++ V 1.0",

    "description" : "F3D is written in OpenCL, so it achieve[sic] platform-portable parallelism on modern mutli-core CPUs and many-core GPUs. The interface and mechanims to access F3D core are written in Java as a plugin for Fiji/ImageJ to deliver several key image-processing algorithms necessary to remove artifacts from micro-tomography data. The algorithms consist of data parallel aware filters that can efficiently utilizes[sic] resources and can work on out of core datasets and scale efficiently across multiple accelerators. Optimizing for data parallel filters, streaming out of core datasets, and efficient resource and memory and data managements over complex execution sequence of filters greatly expedites any scientific workflow with image processing requirements. F3D performs several different types of 3D image processing operations, such as non-linear filtering using bilateral filtering and/or median filtering and/or morphological operators (MM). F3D gray-level MM operators are one-pass constant time methods that can perform morphological transformations with a line-structuring element oriented in discrete directions. Additionally, MM operators can be applied to gray-scale images, and consist of two parts: (a) a reference shape or structuring element, which is translated over the image, and (b) a mechanism, or operation, that defines the comparisons to be performed between the image and the structuring element. This tool provides a critical component within many complex pipelines such as those for performing automated segmentation of image stacks. F3D is also called a \"descendent\" of Quant-CT, another software we developed in the past. These two modules are to be integrated in a next version. Further details were reported in: D.M.

It solves the Gutzwiller variational problem for general multiband models with arbitrary on-site interaction in a fully self-consistent numerical approach. The underlying algorithm drastically reduces the problem of the high-dimensional Gutzwiller minimization by mapping it to a minimization only in the variational density matrix. For &#64257;xed density the Gutzwiller renormalization matrix is determined as a &#64257;x-point of a proper functional, whose evaluation requires only ground-state calculations of matrices de&#64257;ned in the Gutzwiller variational space. Furthermore, the package is able to account for the symmetries of the variational function in a controlled way, reducing the number of variational parameters. The software is highly ef&#64257;cient and robust, and is particularly suitable for &#64257;rst-principles studies (e.g., in combination with DFT) of many complex real materials, where the full intra-atomic interaction is important to obtain correct results.",

    "description" : "SVF is a full featured OpenGL 3d framework that allows for rapid creation of complex visualizations. The SVF framework handles much of the lifecycle and complex tasks required for a 3d visualization. Unlike a game framework SVF was designed to use fewer resources, work well in a windowed environment, and only render when necessary. The scene also takes advantage of multiple threads to free up the UI thread as much as possible. Shapes (actors) in the scene are created by adding or removing functionality (through support objects) during runtime. This allows a highly flexible and dynamic means of creating highly complex actors without the code complexity (it also helps overcome the lack of multiple inheritance in Java.) All classes are highly customizable and there are abstract classes which are intended to be subclassed to allow a developer to create more complex and highly performant actors. There are multiple demos included in the framework to help the developer get started and shows off nearly all of the functionality. Some simple shapes (actors) are already created for you such as text, bordered text, radial text, text area, complex paths, NURBS paths, cube, disk, grid, plane, geometric shapes, and volumetric area. It also comes with various camera types for viewing that can be dragged, zoomed, and rotated. Picking or selecting items in the scene can be accomplished in various ways depending on your needs (raycasting or color picking.) The framework currently has functionality for tooltips, animation, actor pools, color gradients, 2d physics, text, 1d/2d/3d textures, children, blending, clipping planes, view frustum culling, custom shaders, and custom actor states",

    "description" : "The FireHose Streaming Benchmarks are a suite of stream-processing benchmarks defined to enable comparison of streaming software and hardware, both quantitatively vis-a-vis the rate at which they can process data, and qualitatively by judging the effort involved to implement and run the benchmarks. Each benchmark has two parts. The first is a generator which produces and outputs datums at a high rate in a specific format. The second is an analytic which reads the stream of datums and is required to perform a well-defined calculation on the collection of datums, typically to find anomalous datums that have been created in the stream by the generator. The FireHose suite provides code for the generators, sample code for the analytics (which users are free to re-implement in their own custom frameworks), and a precise definition of each benchmark calculation.",

    "description" : "brulilo is a Python package for building and evolving thermonuclear reaction networks, such as those used in astrophysical explosion calculations. It is very much a current work in progress, and much of the intended functionality is still under development. The main goal of brulilo is an easy-to-use code for quick calculations or post-processing, as well as a learning tool to test various implementations of solvers on both CPUs and GPUs. Currently, brulilo parses an input text file that specifies the reactions to be included in the network. The notation of the inputs are in the typical astrophysical notation; i.e. hydrogen burning to deuterium in the sun, \"p + p + e --> d + neutrino\", is given as \"p(p,)d.\" Each reaction is added to a list comprising the reaction network, and once completed, the network contains a list of all isotopes and reactions involved. brulilo then parses publicly available nuclear data (binding energy, spin, partition function data, etc.) for each isotope from the WebNucleo group's data at nucleo.ces.clemson.edu. Fits to reaction rate data for each reaction are obtained from the publicly available data provided by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics' Reaclib database. Reverse reactions are calculated from detailed balance. The reaction network then consists of a sparse system of mathematically stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Physically, \"stiffness\" here means that there are some reaction rates that are occurring much faster than others; the ratio of the fast to slow often being greater than 10^15 in astrophysics. Numerical integration of such systems typically involves implicit integration schemes, which brulilo will leverage from the scientific computing Python package, Numpy, as well as implement its own. There has recently been work from researchers at Oak Ridge National Lab who have found good results from applying quasi-equilibrium and quasi-asymptotic conditions to the stiff system of ODEs, which effectively remove some of the stiffness and allow for efficient explicit integration techniques to be used. The original intent of brulilo was to implement these stiffness-alleviating techniques with explicit integrators and compare the performance to traditional implicit integrations of the full stiff system. This is still underway, as the code is very much in an alpha-release state. Furthermore, explicit integrators are often much easier to parallelize than their implicit counterparts. brulilo will implement parallelization of these techniques, leveraging both the Python implementation of MPI, mpi4py, as well as highly parallelized versions targeted at GPUs with PyOpenCL and/or PyCUDA.",

    "description" : "Vector extensions, such as SSE, have been part of the x86 CPU since the 1990s, with applications in graphics, signal processing, and scientific applications. Although many algorithms and applications can naturally benefit from automatic vectorization techniques, there are still many that are difficult to vectorize due to their dependence on irregular data structures, dense branch operations, or data dependencies. Sequence alignment, one of the most widely used operations in bioinformatics workflows, has a computational footprint that features complex data dependencies. The trend of widening vector registers adversely affects the state-of-the-art sequence alignment algorithm based on striped data layouts. Therefore, a novel SIMD implementation of a parallel scan-based sequence alignment algorithm that can better exploit wider SIMD units was implemented as part of the Parallel Sequence Alignment Library (parasail). Parasail features: Reference implementations of all known vectorized sequence alignment approaches. Implementations of Smith Waterman (SW), semi-global (SG), and Needleman Wunsch (NW) sequence alignment algorithms. Implementations across all modern CPU instruction sets including AVX2 and KNC.

    "description" : "One major challenge in the field of shotgun metagenomics is the accurate identification of the organisms present within the community, based on classification of short sequence reads. Though microbial community profiling methods have emerged to attempt to rapidly classify the millions of reads output from contemporary sequencers, the combination of incomplete databases, similarity among otherwise divergent genomes, and the large volumes of sequencing data required for metagenome sequencing has led to unacceptably high false discovery rates (FDR). Here we present the application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling tool with significantly smaller FDR, which is also capable of classifying never-before seen genomes into the appropriate parent taxa.The algorithm is based upon three primary computational phases: (I) genomic decomposition into bit vectors, (II) bit vector intersections to identify shared regions, and (III) bit vector subtractions to remove shared regions and reveal unique, signature regions. In the Decomposition phase, genomic data is first masked to highlight only the valid (non-ambiguous) regions and then decomposed into overlapping 24-mers. The k-mers are sorted along with their start positions, de-replicated, and then prefixed, to minimize data duplication. The prefixes are indexed and an identical data structure is created for the start positions to mimic that of the k-mer data structure. During the Intersection phase -- which is the most computationally intensive phase -- as an all-vs-all comparison is made, the number of comparisons is first reduced by four methods: (a) Prefix restriction, (b) Overlap detection, (c) Overlap restriction, and (d) Result recording. In Prefix restriction, only k-mers of the same prefix are compared. Within that group, potential overlap of k-mer suffixes that would result in a non-empty set intersection are screened for. If such an overlap exists, the region which intersects is first reduced by performing a binary search of the boundary suffixes of the smaller set into the larger set, which defines the limits of the zipper-based intersection process. Rather than recording the actual k-mers of the intersection, another data structure of identical \"shape\" is created which consists of only bit vectors so that only a 1 or 0 will be stored in the location of the k-mer suffix that was found in the intersection. This reduces the amount of data generated and stored considerably. During the Subtraction phase, relevant intersection bitmasks are first unionized together to form a single bitmask which is then applied over the original genome to reveal only those regions of the genome that are unique. These regions are then exported to disk in FASTA format and used in the application of determining the constituents of an unknown metagenomic community.",

    "description" : "One major challenge in the field of shotgun metagenomics is the accurate identification of the organisms present within the community, based on classification of short sequence reads. Though microbial community profiling methods have emerged to attempt to rapidly classify the millions of reads output from contemporary sequencers, the combination of incomplete databases, similarity among otherwise divergent genomes, and the large volumes of sequencing data required for metagenome sequencing has led to unacceptably high false discovery rates (FDR). Here we present the application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling tool with significantly smaller FDR, which is also capable of classifying never-before seen genomes into the appropriate parent taxa.The algorithm is based upon three primary computational phases: (I) genomic decomposition into bit vectors, (II) bit vector intersections to identify shared regions, and (III) bit vector subtractions to remove shared regions and reveal unique, signature regions.In the Decomposition phase, genomic data is first masked to highlight only the valid (non-ambiguous) regions and then decomposed into overlapping 24-mers. The k-mers are sorted along with their start positions, de-replicated, and then prefixed, to minimize data duplication. The prefixes are indexed and an identical data structure is created for the start positions to mimic that of the k-mer data structure.During the Intersection phase -- which is the most computationally intensive phase -- as an all-vs-all comparison is made, the number of comparisons is first reduced by four methods: (a) Prefix restriction, (b) Overlap detection, (c) Overlap restriction, and (d) Result recording. In Prefix restriction, only k-mers of the same prefix are compared. Within that group, potential overlap of k-mer suffixes that would result in a non-empty set intersection are screened for. If such an overlap exists, the region which intersects is first reduced by performing a binary search of the boundary suffixes of the smaller set into the larger set, which defines the limits of the zipper-based intersection process. Rather than recording the actual k-mers of the intersection, another data structure of identical \"shape\" is created which consists of only bit vectors so that only a 1 or 0 will be stored in the location of the k-mer suffix that was found in the intersection. This reduces the amount of data generated and stored considerably.During the Subtraction phase, relevant intersection bitmasks are first unionized together to form a single bitmask which is then applied over the original genome to reveal only those regions of the genome that are unique. These regions are then exported to disk in FASTA format and used in the application of determining the constituents of an unknown metagenomic community.The DATABASE provided is the result of the algorithm described.",

    "description" : "Cloud droplet number concentration is an important factor in understanding aerosol-cloud interactions. As aerosol concentration increases, it is expected that droplet number concentration (Nd) will increase and droplet size will decrease, for a given liquid water path. This will greatly affect cloud albedo as smaller droplets reflect more shortwave radiation&#894; however, the magnitude and variability of these processes under different environmental conditions is still uncertain.McComiskey et al. (2009) have implemented a method, based onBoers and Mitchell (1994), for calculating Nd from ground-based remote sensing measurements of optical depth and liquid water path. They show that the magnitude of the aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) varies with a range of factors, including the relative value of the cloud liquid water path (LWP), the aerosol size distribution, and the cloud updraft velocity. Estimates of Nd under a range of cloud types and conditions and at a variety of sites are needed to further quantify the impacts of aerosol cloud interactions. In order to provide data sets for studying aerosol-cloud interactions, the McComiskey et al. (2009) method was implemented as the Droplet Number Concentration (NDROP) value-added product (VAP).",

    "description" : "Many simulation software produce data in the form of a set of field values or of a set of particle positions. (one such example is that of particle-in-cell codes, which produce data on the electromagnetic fields that they simulate.) However, each particular software uses its own particular format and layout, for the output data. This makes it difficult to compare the results of different simulation software, or to have a common visualization tool for these results. However, a standardized layout for fields and particles has recently been developed: the openPMD format ( HYPERLINK \"http://www.openpmd.org/\"www.openpmd.org) This format is open- source, and specifies a standard way in which field data and particle data should be written. The openPMD format is already implemented in the particle-in-cell code Warp (developed at LBL) and in PIConGPU (developed at HZDR, Germany). In this context, the proposed software (openPMD-viewer) is a Python package, which allows to access and visualize any data which has been formatted according to the openPMD standard. This package contains two main components: - a Python API, which allows to read and extract the data from a openPMD file, so as to be able to work with it within the Python environment. (e.g. plot the data and reprocess it with particular Python functions) - a graphical interface, which works with the ipython notebook, and allows to quickly visualize the data and browse through a set of openPMD files. The proposed software will be typically used when analyzing the results of numerical simulations. It will be useful to quickly extract scientific meaning from a set of numerical data.",

    "description" : "Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes. It is a multi-organizational effort to create and formulate high quality 0D and 1D constitutive modeling tools for reactive transport codes.Institutions involved with the effort include Sandia, MIT, Colorado School of Mines, U. Texas, NASA, and Oak Ridge National Labs. Specific to Sandia's contributions, the Cantera Electrolyte Thermo Objects (CETO) packages is comprised of add-on routines for Cantera that handle electrolyte thermochemistry and reactions within the overall Cantera package. Cantera is a C++ Cal Tech code that handles gas phase species transport, reaction, and thermodynamics. With this addition, Cantera can be extended to handle problems involving liquid phase reactions and transport in electrolyte systems, and phase equilibrium problemsinvolving concentrated electrolytes and gas/solid phases. A full treatment of molten salt thermodynamics and transport has also been implemented in CETO. The routines themselves consist of .cpp and .h files containing C++ objects that are derived from parent Cantera objects representing thermodynamic functions. They are linked unto the main Cantera libraries when requested by the user. As an addendum to the main thermodynamics objects, several utility applications are provided. The first is multiphase Gibbs free energy minimizer based on the vcs algorithm, called vcs_cantera. This code allows for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibrium in multiple phases at constant temperature and pressure. Note, a similar code capability exists already in Cantera. This version follows the same algorithm, but gas a different code-base starting point, and is used as a research tool for algorithm development. The second program, cttables, prints out tables of thermodynamic and kinetic information for thermodynamic and kinetic objects within Cantera. This program serves as a \"Get the numbers out\" utility for Cantera, and as such it is very useful as a verification tool. These add-on utilities are encapsulated into a directory structure named cantera_apps, whose installation uses autoconf and also utilizes Cantera's application environment (i.e., they utilize Cantera as a library).",

In its simplest mode, Dakota can automate typical parameter variation studies through a generic interface to a computational model. However, Dakota also delivers advanced parametric analysis techniques enabling design exploration, optimization, model calibration, risk analysis, and quantification of margins and uncertainty with such models. It directly supports verification and validation activities. The algorithms implemented in Dakota aim to address challenges in performing these analyses with complex science and engineering models from desktop to high performance computers.",

The code modified by SNL has been named SNL-SWAN. SNL-SWAN includes a frequency dependent WEC Module that builds upon the traditional obstacle module in SWAN. In SNL-SWAN, a frequency dependent transmission coefficient is calculated to model power absorbed by WEC devices. The power transmission coefficients are calculated based on the WEC's power performance, which is defined by the user in the input text files. Two methods of defining WEC power performance have been implemented: a user-specified power matrix, and a user-specified relative capture width. These methods allow the user to define the WEC's frequency dependent energy absorption as a function of period and/or wave height. SWAN test cases were run to verify the compiled code's functionality, and verification of the frequency dependent WEC Module in SNL-SWAN has also been performed. SNL-SWAN code is will be released as open source code and will be made publicly available.",

    "description" : "The visualization enables the simulation analyst to see changes in the frequency through time and space. With this technology, the analyst has a bird's eye view of the frequency at loads and generators as the simulated power system responds to the loss of a generator, spikes in load, and other contingencies. The significance of a contingency to the operation of an electrical power system depends critically on how the resulting tansients evolve in time and space. Consequently, these dynamic events can only be understood when seen in their proper geographic context. this understanding is indispensable to engineers working on the next generation of distributed sensing and control systems for the smart grid. By making possible a natural and intuitive presentation of dynamic behavior, our new visualization technology is a situational-awareness tool for power-system engineers.",

    "description" : "RVA is a plugin developed for the 64-bit Windows version of the ParaView 3.14 visualization package. RVA is designed to provide support in the visualization and analysis of complex reservoirs being managed using multi-fluid EOR techniques. RVA, for Reservoir Visualization and Analysis, was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with contributions from the Illinois State Geological Survey, Department of Computer Science and National Center for Supercomputing Applications. RVA was designed to utilize and enhance the state-of-the-art visualization capabilities within ParaView, readily allowing joint visualization of geologic framework and reservoir fluid simulation model results. Particular emphasis was placed on enabling visualization and analysis of simulation results highlighting multiple fluid phases, multiple properties for each fluid phase (including flow lines), multiple geologic models and multiple time steps. Additional advanced functionality was provided through the development of custom code to implement data mining capabilities. The built-in functionality of ParaView provides the capacity to process and visualize data sets ranging from small models on local desktop systems to extremely large models created and stored on remote supercomputers. The RVA plugin that we developed and the associated User Manual provide improved functionality through new software tools, and instruction in the use of ParaView-RVA, targeted to petroleum engineers and geologists in industry and research. The RVA web site (http://rva.cs.illinois.edu) provides an overview of functions, and the development web site (https://github.com/shaffer1/RVA) provides ready access to the source code, compiled binaries, user manual, and a suite of demonstration data sets. Key functionality has been included to support a range of reservoirs visualization and analysis needs, including: sophisticated connectivity analysis, cross sections through simulation results between selected wells, simplified volumetric calculations, global vertical exaggeration adjustments, ingestion of UTChem simulation results, ingestion of Isatis geostatistical framework models, interrogation of joint geologic and reservoir modeling results, joint visualization and analysis of well history files, location-targeted visualization, advanced correlation analysis, visualization of flow paths, and creation of static images and animations highlighting targeted reservoir features.",

Users provide the software a quantitative description of a meteorological event they are interested in; the software searches a data set for locations in space and time that meet the user鈥檚 description. In its first stage, Stride Search performs a spatial search of the data set at each timestep by dividing a search domain into circular sectors of constant geodesic radius. Data from a netCDF file is read into memory for each circular search sector. If the data meet or exceed a set of storm identification criteria (defined by the user), a storm is recorded to a linked list. Finally, the linked list is examined and duplicate detections of the same storm are removed and the results are written to an output file. The first stage鈥檚 output file is read by a second program that builds storm. Additional identification criteria may be applied at this stage to further classify storms. Storm tracks are the software鈥檚 ultimate output and routines are provided for formatting that output for various external software libraries for plotting and tabulating data.",

Analysts inspect these alerts to decide if any deserve promotion to an event requiring further scrutiny.

We have created a software system that uses supervised machine learning to automatically prioritize these alerts. In particular we utilize active learning to make efficient use of the pool of unlabeled alerts, thereby improving the performance of our ranking models over passive learning.

    "description" : "This application can determine the performance and chemical behavior of batteries in 1D when they are cycled. With CanTrilBat, we are developing predictive phenomenological models for battery systems to predict operating performance and rate limiting steps in the performance of battery models. Particular attention is paid to primary and secondary chemistry mechanisms, such as the thermal runaway mechanisms experienced in secondary lithium ion batteries or self-discharge reaction mechanism that all batteries experience to one extent or another. The first application of this model has been for modeling the performance of thermal batteries. However, an implementation for secondary ion batteries is next. CanTrilBat applications solves transient problems involving batteries. It is a 1-D application that represents 3-D physical systems that can be reduced using the porous flow approximation for the anode, cathode, and separator. A control volume formulation is used to track conserved quantities. An operator-split approach is used to calculate the chemistry, diffusion and electronic transport that occurs within cathode and anode particles, allowing for the reduction in code complexity. All jacobian operations in CanTrilBat utilize numerical jacobians. A home grown predictor corrector scheme is used for time step control, and a home grown newton solver is used to relax the equations at each time step. Trilinos is used to solve for the resulting linear systems equation A block text input format is used to initialize options for the CanTriBat program. Within this block are the names of several XML input files, which specify the chemistry mechanism. These XML input files are read by low level Cantera routines, and serve to initialize the electrode and electrolyte chemistry mechanisms and transport properties. A GUI implementation has been contracted out to a university professor, but has not been implemented yet. It?s expected that CanTriBat will have the capability to do adaptive grid refinement in later versions. Grids will be halved based on an complicated set of heuristic criteria, based on how well the mesh captures changes to the first and second derivatives of selected solution components. Primary emphasis is given towards converged profiles for IV performance.",

Another goal is to provide the authors and venders with some meaningful feedback regarding the capabilities and limitations of their models. The actual application is a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using either the Lennard-Jones method (LJ) or the embedded atom method (EAM) for primary particle interaction. The code can be extended to support alternate interaction models. The code is expected ro run on a wide class of heterogeneous hardware configurations like shard/distributed/hybrid memory, GPU's and any other platform supported by the underlying programming model.",

For such large runs, storing most time steps for later analysis is not a viable strategy. It is far more efficient to analyze the simulation data while it is still in memory.

They present Henson, an implementation of our design, and illustrate its versatility by tackling analysis tasks with different computational requirements. Our design differs significantly from the existing frameworks and offers an efficient and robust approach to integrating multiple codes on modern supercomputers.

    "description" : "FleCSI is a compile-time configurable framework designed to support multi-physics application development. As such, FleCSI attempts to provide a very general set of infrastructure design patterns that can be specialized and extended to suit the needs of a broad variety of solver and data requirements. Current support includes multi-dimensional mesh topology, mesh geometry, and mesh adjacency information, n-dimensional hashed-tree data structures, graph partitioning interfaces, and dependency closures. FleCSI also introduces a functional programming model with control, execution, and data abstractions that are consistent with both MPI and state-of-the-art task-based runtimes such as Legion and Charm++. The FleCSI abstraction layer provides the developer with insulation from the underlying runtime, while allowing support for multiple runtime systems, including conventional models like asynchronous MPI. The intent is to give developers a concrete set of user-friendly programming tools that can be used now, while allowing flexibility in choosing runtime implementations and optimizations that can be applied to architectures and runtimes that arise in the future. The control and execution models in FleCSI also provide formal nomenclature for describing poorly understood concepts like kernels and tasks.",

    "description" : "Virtual Flow Simulator (VFS) is a state-of-the-art computational fluid mechanics (CFD) package that is capable of simulating multi-physics/multi-phase flows with the most advanced turbulence models (RANS, LES) over complex terrains. The flow solver is based on the Curvilinear Immersed Boundary (CURVIB) method to handle geometrically complex and moving domains. Different modules of the VFS package can provide different simulation capabilities for specific applications ranging from the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of solid and deformable bodies, the two-phase free surface flow solver based on the level set method for ocean waves, sediment transport models in rivers and the large-scale models of wind farms based on actuator lines and surfaces. All numerical features of VFS package have been validated with known analytical and experimental data as reported in the related journal articles. VFS package is suitable for a broad range of engineering applications within different industries. VFS has been used in different projects with applications in wind and hydrokinetic energy, offshore and near-shore ocean studies, cardiovascular and biological flows, and natural streams and river morphodynamics. Over the last decade, the development of VFS has been supported and assisted with the help of various United States companies and federal agencies that are listed in the sponsor lists. In this version, VFS-Wind contains all the necessary modeling tools for wind energy applications, including land-based and offshore wind farms. VFS is highly scalable to run on either desktop computers or high performance clusters (up to 16,000 CPUs). This released version comes with a detailed user鈥檚 manual and a set of case studies designed to facilitate the learning of the various aspects of the code in a comprehensive manner. The included documentation and support material has been elaborated in a collaboration effort with Sandia National Labs under the contract DE-EE0005482. The VFS-Wind source code is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL 2.0), offering to the community the flexibility to use and expand the capabilities of the package.

It is implemented over existing networks, specifically Ethernet and InfiniBand networks.

It can be used to develop software using the Portals API prior to the debut of Portals networking hardware, such as Bull鈥檚 BXI interconnect, as well as a substitute for portals hardware on development platforms that do not have Portals compliant hardware. The reference implementation provides new capabilities beyond that of a typical network, namely the ability to have messages matched in hardware in a way compatible with upper layer software such as MPI or SHMEM. It also offers methods of offloading network operations via triggered operations, which can be used to create offloaded collective operations.

    "description" : "The Response Surface Modeling (RSM) Tool Suite is a collection of three codes used to generate an empirical interpolation function for a collection of drag coefficient calculations computed with Test Particle Monte Carlo (TPMC) simulations. The first code, \"Automated RSM\", automates the generation of a drag coefficient RSM for a particular object to a single command. \"Automated RSM\" first creates a Latin Hypercube Sample (LHS) of 1,000 ensemble members to explore the global parameter space. For each ensemble member, a TPMC simulation is performed and the object drag coefficient is computed. In the next step of the \"Automated RSM\" code, a Gaussian process is used to fit the TPMC simulations. In the final step, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to evaluate the non-analytic probability distribution function from the Gaussian process. The second code, \"RSM Area\", creates a look-up table for the projected area of the object based on input limits on the minimum and maximum allowed pitch and yaw angles and pitch and yaw angle intervals. The projected area from the look-up table is used to compute the ballistic coefficient of the object based on its pitch and yaw angle. An accurate ballistic coefficient is crucial in accurately computing the drag on an object. The third code, \"RSM Cd\", uses the RSM generated by the \"Automated RSM\" code and the projected area look-up table generated by the \"RSM Area\" code to accurately compute the drag coefficient and ballistic coefficient of the object. The user can modify the object velocity, object surface temperature, the translational temperature of the gas, the species concentrations of the gas, and the pitch and yaw angles of the object. Together, these codes allow for the accurate derivation of an object's drag coefficient and ballistic coefficient under any conditions with only knowledge of the object's geometry and mass.",

    "description" : "The Kokkos Clang compiler is a version of the Clang C++ compiler that has been modified to perform targeted code generation for Kokkos constructs in the goal of generating highly optimized code and to provide semantic (domain) awareness throughout the compilation toolchain of these constructs such as parallel for and parallel reduce. This approach is taken to explore the possibilities of exposing the developer鈥檚 intentions to the underlying compiler infrastructure (e.g. optimization and analysis passes within the middle stages of the compiler) instead of relying solely on the restricted capabilities of C++ template metaprogramming. To date our current activities have focused on correct GPU code generation and thus we have not yet focused on improving overall performance. The compiler is implemented by recognizing specific (syntactic) Kokkos constructs in order to bypass normal template expansion mechanisms and instead use the semantic knowledge of Kokkos to directly generate code in the compiler鈥檚 intermediate representation (IR); which is then translated into an NVIDIA-centric GPU program and supporting runtime calls. In addition, by capturing and maintaining the higher-level semantics of Kokkos directly within the lower levels of the compiler has the potential for significantly improving the ability of the compiler to communicate with the developer in the terms of their original programming model/semantics.",

    "description" : "The software is designed for efficiently integrating large-size of multi-scale environmental data using the Bayesian framework. Suppose we need to estimate the spatial distribution of variable X with high spatial resolution. The available data include (1) direct measurements Z of the unknowns with high resolution in a subset of the spatial domain (small spatial coverage), (2) measurements C of the unknowns at the median scale, and (3) measurements A of the unknowns at the coarsest scale but with large spatial coverage. The goal is to estimate the unknowns at the fine grids by conditioning to all the available data. We first consider all the unknowns as random variables and estimate conditional probability distribution of those variables by conditioning to the limited high-resolution observations (Z). We then treat the estimated probability distribution as the prior distribution. Within the Bayesian framework, we combine the median and large-scale measurements (C and A) through likelihood functions. Since we assume that all the relevant multivariate distributions are Gaussian, the resulting posterior distribution is a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The developed software provides numerical solutions of the posterior probability distribution. The software can be extended in several different ways to solve more general multi-scale data integration problems.",

It is a 鈥渮-code鈥� that contains typical linac beam transport elements. The linac RF-gap transformation utilizes transit-time-factors to calculate the beam acceleration therein. The space-charge effects are computed using the 2D SCHEFF (Space CHarge EFFect) algorithm, which calculates the radial and longitudinal space charge forces for cylindrically symmetric beam distributions. Other space- charge routines to be incorporated include the 3D PICNIC and a 3D Poisson solver. HPSim can simulate beam dynamics in drift tube linacs (DTLs) and coupled cavity linacs (CCLs). Elliptical superconducting cavity (SC) structures will also be incorporated into the code. The computational core of the code is written in C++ and accelerated using the NVIDIA CUDA technology. Users access the core code, which is wrapped in Python/C APIs, via Pythons scripts that enable ease-of-use and automation of the simulations. The overall linac description including the EPICS PV machine control parameters is kept in an SQLite database that also contains calibration and conversion factors required to transform the machine set points into model values used in the simulation.",

The molecules within the periodic simulation cell are treated as rigid bodies, alleviating the requirement for a complex interatomic potential. Intermolecular interactions are described using generic, atom-centered pair potentials whose parameterization is taken from the literature [D. E. Williams, J. Comput. Chem., 22, 1154 (2001)] and electrostatic interactions arising from atom-centered, fixed, point partial charges. The primary uses of the MC3 code are the computation of i) the temperature and pressure dependence of lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, ii) tensors of elastic constants and compliances via the Parrinello and Rahman鈥檚 fluctuation formula [M. Parrinello and A. Rahman, J. Chem. Phys., 76, 2662 (1982)], and iii) the investigation of polymorphic phase transformations. The MC3 code is written in Fortran90 and requires LAPACK and BLAS linear algebra libraries to be linked during compilation. Computationally expensive loops are accelerated using OpenMP.",

These components are written in the C programming language. search: The search components provide a means to find relevant flows and the associated packets. A search query is parsed and represented as a search tree. Various search commands, written in C, are then used resolve this tree into a set of search results. The tree generation and search execution management components are written in python. interface: The PcapDB web interface is written in Python on the Django framework. It provides a series of pages, API's, and asynchronous tasks that allow the user to manage the capture system, perform searches, and retrieve results.

    "description" : "A common operation in scientific visualization is to compute and render a contour of a data set. Given a function of the form f : R^d -> R, a level set is defined as an inverse image f^-1(h) for an isovalue h, and a contour is a single connected component of a level set. The Reeb graph can then be defined to be the result of contracting each contour to a single point, and is well defined for Euclidean spaces or for general manifolds. For simple domains, the graph is guaranteed to be a tree, and is called the contour tree. Analysis can then be performed on the contour tree in order to identify isovalues of particular interest, based on various metrics, and render the corresponding contours, without having to know such isovalues a priori. This code is intended to be the first data-parallel algorithm for computing contour trees. Our implementation will use the portable data-parallel primitives provided by Nvidia鈥檚 Thrust library, allowing us to compile our same code for both GPUs and multi-core CPUs. Native OpenMP and purely serial versions of the code will likely also be included. It will also be extended to provide a hybrid data-parallel / distributed algorithm, allowing scaling beyond a single GPU or CPU.",

This method is part of the Accelerated Molecular Dynamics family of techniques developed in Los Alamos National Laboratory over the last 16 years.

ParSplice uses multiple independent replicas of the system in order to parallelize the generation of such trajectories in the time domain, enabling simulations of systems of modest size over very long timescales. ParSplice includes capabilities to store configurations of the system, to generate and distribute tasks across a large number of processors, and to harvest the results of these tasks to generate long trajectories. ParSplice is a management layer that orchestrate large number of calculations, but it does not perform the actual molecular dynamics itself; this is done by external molecular dynamics engines.

    "description" : "Finding Godsil-McKay switching sets in graphs is one way to demonstrate that a specific graph is not determined by its spectrum--the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. An important area of active research in pure mathematics is determining which graphs are determined by their spectra, i.e. when the spectrum of the adjacency matrix uniquely determines the underlying graph. We are interested in exploring the spectra of graphs in the Johnson scheme and specifically seek to determine which of these graphs are determined by their spectra. Given a graph G, a Godsil-McKay switching set is an induced subgraph H on 2k vertices with the following properties: I) H is regular, ii) every vertex in G/H is adjacent to either 0, k, or 2k vertices of H, and iii) at least one vertex in G/H is adjacent to k vertices in H. The software package examines each subset of a user specified size to determine whether or not it satisfies those 3 conditions. The software makes use of the massive parallel processing power of CUDA enabled GPUs. It also exploits the vertex transitivity of graphs in the Johnson scheme by reasoning that if G has a Godsil-McKay switching set, then it has a switching set which includes vertex 1. While the code (in its current state) is tuned to this specific problem, the method of examining each induced subgraph of G can be easily re-written to check for any user specified conditions on the subgraphs and can therefore be used much more broadly.",

These converted models are used as the basis for 2 products, one of which is the focus of this review: an engineering design interface for Fissile Solution Systems. ModelConverter.exe (C#) converts DESIRE model inputs to a C++ plug-in subclass. SimApp.exe (C# / C++) has a C++ dll that is a numerical integration engine that the Converted models plug into. The engineering design interface is a C# GUI that calls on the C++ dll to execute a particular converted model. The GUI allows the user to specify the length of a simulation, run the simulation, view data plots and data tables. Stability plots may also be produced and manipulated. The engineering design interface will be released as source code and executable; the model converter source is also intended for release.",

    "description" : "WARP, which can stand for ``Weaving All the Random Particles,'' is a three-dimensional (3D) continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport code developed at UC Berkeley to efficiently execute on NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms. WARP accelerates Monte Carlo simulations while preserving the benefits of using the Monte Carlo method, namely, that very few physical and geometrical simplifications are applied. WARP is able to calculate multiplication factors, neutron flux distributions (in both space and energy), and fission source distributions for time-independent neutron transport problems. It can run in both criticality or fixed source modes, but fixed source mode is currently not robust, optimized, or maintained in the newest version. WARP can transport neutrons in unrestricted arrangements of parallelepipeds, hexagonal prisms, cylinders, and spheres. The goal of developing WARP is to investigate algorithms that can grow into a full-featured, continuous energy, Monte Carlo neutron transport code that is accelerated by running on GPUs. The crux of the effort is to make Monte Carlo calculations faster while producing accurate results. Modern supercomputers are commonly being built with GPU coprocessor cards in their nodes to increase their computational efficiency and performance. GPUs execute efficiently on data-parallel problems, but most CPU codes, including those for Monte Carlo neutral particle transport, are predominantly task-parallel. WARP uses a data-parallel neutron transport algorithm to take advantage of the computing power GPUs offer.",

On the software side, a simple, flexible way of identifying and working with memory pools is needed. Additionally, most developers seek code portability and do not want to learn the intricacies of complex memory. Hence, we believe that a library for interacting with complex memory systems should expose two kinds of abstraction: First, a low-level, mechanism-based interface designed for the runtime or advanced user that wants complete control, with its focus on simplified representation but with all decisions left to the caller. Second, a high-level, policy-based interface designed for ease of use for the application developer, in which we aim for best-practice decisions based on application intent.

EOSlib provides a single, consistent, verifiable implementation of these models, in a single, easy-to-use software package. It consists of three parts: a software library implementing various published equation-of-state (EOS) models; a database of fitting parameters for various materials for these models; and a number of useful utility functions for simplifying thermodynamic calculations such as computing Hugoniot curves or Riemann problem solutions. Ready availability of this library will enable reliable code-to- code testing of equation-of-state implementations, as well as a starting point for more rigorous verification work. EOSlib also provides a single, consistent API for its analytic and tabular EOS models, which simplifies the process of comparing models for a particular application.",

    "description" : "At exascale, the challenge becomes to develop applications that run at scale and use exascale platforms reliably, efficiently, and flexibly. Workflows become much more complex because they must seamlessly integrate simulation and data analytics. They must include down-sampling, post-processing, feature extraction, and visualization. Power and data transfer limitations require these analysis tasks to be run in-situ or in-transit. We expect successful workflows will comprise multiple linked simulations along with tens of analysis routines. Users will have limited development time at scale and, therefore, must have rich tools to develop, debug, test, and deploy applications. At this scale, successful workflows will compose linked computations from an assortment of reliable, well-defined computation elements, ones that can come and go as required, based on the needs of the workflow over time. We propose a novel framework that utilizes both virtual machines (VMs) and software containers to create a workflow system that establishes a uniform build and execution environment (BEE) beyond the capabilities of current systems. In this environment, applications will run reliably and repeatably across heterogeneous hardware and software. Containers, both commercial (Docker and Rocket) and open-source (LXC and LXD), define a runtime that isolates all software dependencies from the machine operating system. Workflows may contain multiple containers that run different operating systems, different software, and even different versions of the same software. We will run containers in open-source virtual machines (KVM) and emulators (QEMU) so that workflows run on any machine entirely in user-space. On this platform of containers and virtual machines, we will deliver workflow software that provides services, including repeatable execution, provenance, checkpointing, and future proofing. We will capture provenance about how containers were launched and how they interact to annotate workflows for repeatable and partial re-execution. We will coordinate the physical snapshots of virtual machines with parallel programming constructs, such as barriers, to automate checkpoint and restart. We will also integrate with HPC-specific container runtimes to gain access to accelerators and other specialized hardware to preserve native performance. Containers will link development to continuous integration. When application developers check code in, it will automatically be tested on a suite of different software and hardware architectures.",

    "description" : "Charliecloud is a set of scripts to let users run a virtual cluster of virtual machines (VMs) on a desktop or supercomputer. Key functions include: 1. Creating (typically by installing an operating system from vendor media) and updating VM images; 2. Running a single VM; 3. Running multiple VMs in a virtual cluster. The virtual machines can talk to one another over the network and (in some cases) the outside world. This is accomplished by calling external programs such as QEMU and the Virtual Distributed Ethernet (VDE) suite. The goal is to let users have a virtual cluster containing nodes where they have privileged access, while isolating that privilege within the virtual cluster so it cannot affect the physical compute resources. Host configuration enforces security; this is not included in Charliecloud, though security guidelines are included in its documentation and Charliecloud is designed to facilitate such configuration. Charliecloud manages passing information from host computers into and out of the virtual machines, such as parameters of the virtual cluster, input data specified by the user, output data from virtual compute jobs, VM console display, and network connections (e.g., SSH or X11). Parameters for the virtual cluster (number of VMs, RAM and disk per VM, etc.) are specified by the user or gathered from the environment (e.g., SLURM environment variables). Example job scripts are included. These include computation examples (such as a \"hello world\" MPI job) as well as performance tests. They also include a security test script to verify that the virtual cluster is appropriately sandboxed. Tests include: 1. Pinging hosts inside and outside the virtual cluster to explore connectivity; 2. Port scans (again inside and outside) to see what services are available; 3. Sniffing tests to see what traffic is visible to running VMs; 4. IP address spoofing to test network functionality in this case; 5. File access tests to make sure host access permissions are enforced. This test script is not a comprehensive scanner and does not test for specific vulnerabilities. Importantly, no information about physical hosts or network topology is included in this script (or any of Charliecloud); while part of a sensible test, such information is specified by the user when the test is run. That is, one cannot learn anything about the LANL network or computing infrastructure by examining Charliecloud code.",

It was originally designed to be compatible with the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), an ocean circulation model developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for use on massively parallel computers. CICE has several interacting components: a vertical thermodynamic model that computes local growth rates of snow and ice due to vertical conductive, radiative and turbulent fluxes, along with snowfall; an elastic-viscous-plastic model of ice dynamics, which predicts the velocity field of the ice pack based on a model of the material strength of the ice; an incremental remapping transport model that describes horizontal advection of the areal concentration, ice and snow volume and other state variables; and a ridging parameterization that transfers ice among thickness categories based on energetic balances and rates of strain. It also includes a biogeochemical model that describes evolution of the ice ecosystem. The CICE sea ice model is used for climate research as one component of complex global earth system models that include atmosphere, land, ocean and biogeochemistry components. It is also used for operational sea ice forecasting in the polar regions and in numerical weather prediction models.",

Footprints and locations for new buildings and district systems can also be specified. OpenStudio Measures are used to create starting point energy models and to model energy design features and efficiency measures for each building. URBANopt allows a user to pose several scenarios such as 鈥渨hat if 30% of the commercial retail buildings added roof top solar鈥� or 鈥渨hat if all elementary schools converted to ground source heat pumps鈥� and then visualize the impacts at a district or city scale. URBANopt is capable of modeling existing buildings, new construction, and district energy systems. URBANopt can be used to explore options for achieving Zero Energy across a collection of buildings (e.g., Zero Energy Districts).",

    "description" : "In most Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) available in the market, different devices running different communication protocols cannot interact with each other and exchange information. As a result of this integration, the information about different devices running different communication protocol can be accessible by other agents and devices running on VOLTTRON platform. The integration process can be used by any HEMS available in the market regardless of the programming language they use. If the existing HEMS provides an Application Programming Interface (API) based on the RESTFul architecture, that API can be used for integration. Our candidate HEMS in this project is home-assistant (Hass). An agent is implemented which can communicate with the Hass API and receives information about the devices loaded on the API. The agent publishes the information it receives on the VOLTTRON message bus so other agents can have access to this information. On the other side, for each type of devices, an agent is implemented such as Climate Agent, Lock Agent, Switch Agent, Light Agent, etc. Each of these agents is subscribed to the messages published on the message bus about their associated devices. These agents can also change the status of the devices by sending appropriate service calls to the API. Other agents and services on the platform can also access this information and coordinate their decision-making process based on this information.",

The models are simplified versions that retain the fundamental computational complexity of the Truchas models while omitting many non-essential features and modeling capabilities. The purpose is to expose Truchas algorithms in a greatly simplified context where computer science problems related to parallel performance on advanced architectures can be more easily investigated. While Pececillo is capable of performing simulations representative of typical Truchas metal casting, welding, and additive manufacturing simulations, it lacks many of the modeling capabilites needed for real applications.",

It solves the compressible Navier-Stokes with multispecies transport in a block structured framework. The resulting algorithm is well suited for flows with localized resolution requirements and robust to discontinuities. User controllable refinement crieteria has the potential to result in extremely small numerical dissipation and dispersion, making this code appropriate for both research and applied usage. The code is built on the AMReX library which facilitates hierarchical parallelism and manages distributed memory parallism. PeleC algorithms are implemented to express shared memory parallelism.",

    "description" : "AMG is a parallel algebraic multigrid solver for linear systems arising from problems on unstructured grids. It has been derived directly from the BoomerAMG solver in the hypre library, a large linear solvers library that is being developed in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at LLNL and is very similar to the AMG2013 benchmark with additional optimizations. The driver provided in the benchmark can build various test problems. The default problem is a Laplace type problem with a 27-point stencil, which can be scaled up and is designed to solve a very large problem. A second problem simulates a time dependent problem, in which successively various smnllcr systems are solved.",

    "description" : "This is the repository for Building Energy Management Open Source Software (BEMOSS), which is an open source operating system that is engineered to improve sensing and control of equipment in small- and medium-sized commercial buildings. BEMOSS offers the following key features: (1) Open source, open architecture 鈥� BEMOSS is an open source operating system that is built upon VOLTTRON 鈥� a distributed agent platform developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). BEMOSS was designed to make it easy for hardware manufacturers to seamlessly interface their devices with BEMOSS. Software developers can also contribute to adding additional BEMOSS functionalities and applications. (2) Plug & play 鈥� BEMOSS was designed to automatically discover supported load controllers (including smart thermostats, VAV/RTUs, lighting load controllers and plug load controllers) in commercial buildings. (3) Interoperability 鈥� BEMOSS was designed to work with load control devices form different manufacturers that operate on different communication technologies and data exchange protocols. (4) Cost effectiveness 鈥� Implementation of BEMOSS deemed to be cost-effective as it was built upon a robust open source platform that can operate on a low-cost single-board computer, such as Odroid. This feature could contribute to its rapid deployment in small- or medium-sized commercial buildings. (5) Scalability and ease of deployment 鈥� With its multi-node architecture, BEMOSS provides a distributed architecture where load controllers in a multi-floor and high occupancy building could be monitored and controlled by multiple single-board computers hosting BEMOSS. This makes it possible for a building engineer to deploy BEMOSS in one zone of a building, be comfortable with its operation, and later on expand the deployment to the entire building to make it more energy efficient. (6) Ability to provide local and remote monitoring 鈥� BEMOSS provides both local and remote monitoring ability with role-based access control. (7) Security 鈥� In addition to built-in security features provided by VOLTTRON, BEMOSS provides enhanced security features, including BEMOSS discovery approval process, encrypted core-to-node communication, thermostat anti-tampering feature and many more. (8) Support from the Advisory Committee 鈥� BEMOSS was developed in consultation with an advisory committee from the beginning of the project. BEMOSS advisory committee comprises representatives from 22 organizations from government and industry.",

As such, it performs Monte Carlo integration of probability distributions and generates estimates of unknown quantities based on data and expert opinion if available. Its architecture makes it extensible enought to be helpful in the analysis of any statistical model, so it is particularly useful for statistic researchers. YADAS features a versatile scheme for defining models, and another versatile scheme for defining sampling algorithms that includes a default starting place for most analyses. Models are specified using bonds, which relate unknown parameters using a probability density function through functions that convert the parameters into arguments of the probability density. This structure appears to be versatile enough to be useful for virtually all statistical models. The updating algorighms emphasize componentwise random walk Metropolis algorighm updates, but YADAS also contains a framework for updating correlated parameters together. Reversible jump updates are also supported.",

    "description" : "This software, a library, contains FORTRAN77 subroutines to calculate first and second derivatives up to 8th order, interpolations (1D and 2D) up to 10th order and filters up to 14th order. Only even orders are addressed and finite-difference stencils are implemented on a vertex-centered mesh. The primary aim of this library is to be used in block-structured adaptive mesh simulations where high order is desired. The interpolants in this library are essentially designed to do prolongations and restrictions between levels of rfinement - however, they assume that the refinement ratio is 2. The filters are provided to remove high wavenumber content from solutions in case Runge phenomenon occurs - a common occurrence in case of marginal resolution of the solution. Details of the derivation and use are to be found in \"Using high-order methods on adaptively refined block-structured meshes - discretizations, interpolations and filters\", by J. Ray, C.A. Kennedy, S. Lefantzi and H.N. Najm, Sandia Technical Report, SAND2005-7981. The software comes with a User's Guide and examples how to use it.",

The work extends the functinality provided by the open source Request Tracker (RT) (http://www.bestpractical.com/rt) project witht the Asset Tracker (AT) addon (http://atwiki.chaka.net). We have developed an Event Tracker add-on to RT and an interface for gathering, dispatching, and inserting system events into Event Tracker. Data sources include data from all components of the system. Data is initially sent to a defined set of data filters. The data filters are capable of discarding specified data, throttling input, handling context-sensitive input, passing data through an external shell pipe command, and compressing multiple data enteries into a single event. The filters then pass the data on to an event dispatch engine. The dispatcher can print events to the screen as they happen, track them in the database, forward them on, or pass them on to an external command. By collecting all of the data into a single database, we are able to leverage the Query Builder interface supplied by RT to create, save, and restore almost any kind of query imaginable.",

    "description" : "P-STET assists in the security technology decision making process from a costlbeneflt perspective. It aids in addressing such questions as whether to acquire and deploy new security technology, to re-configure an existing product or system, or to maintain status quo. P-STET offers both a qualitative and quantitative option. P-STET is most efficient when tailored to an organization's security cost/benefit environment. It then serves as both a guide to show what types of security questions should be addressed and as a means to analyze the data gathered from the questions to make an informed decision. The quantitative option provides a straightforward way to express costs/benefits in terms of dollars. It relies on the organization to quantify benefits or cost avoidances, and, therefore, best serves as a guide to ensure various cost and benefit angles are evaluated. The qualitative option allows the organization to assess costs by levels with respect to security and PCS budgets, operational impacts, and opportunity costs. Benefits are represented in terms of improvements to the organization's operations and are also assessed by levels with respect to some benchmark such as compliance with best practices. Results are displayed graphically using radar charts, allowing the user to make a more intuitive decision. The shaded area of each chart represents the overall cost and benefit of the security investment. A good investment is denoted when the ratio of benefit shaded area to cost shaded area is large.",

IBSimu can launch ion beam trajectories into the simulation from an injection surface or fomo plasma. Ion beam space charge of time independent simulations can be taken in account using Viasov iteration. Plasma is calculated by compensating space charge with electrons having Boltzmann energy distribution. The simulation software can also be used to calculate time dependent cases if the space charge is not calculated. Software includes diagnostic tools for plotting the geometry, electric field, space charge map, ion beam trajectories, emittance data and beam profiles.",

SPOT models the sensor placement process as an optimization problem, and the user can specify a wide range of performance objectives for contaminant warning system design, including population health effects, time to detection, extent of contamination, volume consumed and number of failed detections. For example, a SPOT user can integrate expert knowledge during the design process by specigying required sensor placements or designating network locations as forbidden.

It would be up to the site administrator to work out a procedure to capture the steps taken. This tool: streamlines and codifies the installation tasks in a common framework; it provides a self-documenting and unified way for maintaining package installations; uses bash shell variables and functions for portability; keeps log files of the proceedings. It is similar in intent and function to other existing tools, such as RPM, but has several novel features tailored for High Performance Computing (HPC) software deployments. The design goal is simplicity and decoupling from RPM's dependencies and its database, which enables coexistence of several builds. Useful on HPC systems, new builds can be deployed centrally to shared file systems and without affecting running jobs.",

The library is intended toprovide a consistent interface to multiple dimensionality reduction algorithms with an efficient C++ interface that runs efficiently on multicore architectures. A few routines have been optimized with an option for GPU acceleration or distributed computation. Currently the library offers intrinsic dimensionality estimation using point-PCA reconstruction error and/ residual variance. The following dimensionality reduction methods have been implemented: Principal Component Analysis Multidimensional Scaling Locally Linear Embedding IsoMap Autoencoder Neutral Networks An executable is also supplied that can be built to allow for command-line access to the library routines.

    "description" : "The RSTT software computes predictions of the travel time of seismic energy traveling from a source to a receiver through 2.5D models of the seismic velocity distribution within the Earth. The two primary applications for the RSTT library are tomographic inversion studies and seismic event location calculations. In tomographic inversions studies, a seismologist begins with number of source-receiver travel time observations and an initial starting model of the velocity distribution within the Earth. A forward travel time calculator, such as the RSTT library, is used to compute predictions of each observed travel time and all of the residuals (observed minus predicted travel time) are calculated. The Earth model is then modified in some systematic way with the goal of minimizing the residuals. The Earth model obtained in this way is assumed to be a better model than the starting model if it has lower residuals. The other major application for the RSTT library is seismic event location. Given an Earth model, an initial estimate of the location of a seismic event, and some number of observations of seismic travel time thought to have originated from that event, location codes systematically modify the estimate of the location of the event with the goal of minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted travel times. The second application, seismic event location, is routinely implemented by the military as part of its effort to monitor the Earth for nuclear tests conducted by foreign countries.",

The software provides a framework that supports any derivative-free type of solver algorithm. Through the framework, solvers request parallel function evaluation, which may use MPI (multiple machines) or multithreading (multiple processors/cores on one machine). The framework provides a Cache and Pending Cache of saved evaluations that reduces execution time and facilitates restarts. Solvers can dynamically create other algorithms to solve subproblems, a useful technique for handling multiple start points and integer-valued variables. HOPSPACK ships with the Generating Set Search (GSS) algorithm, developed at Sandia as part of the APPSPACK open source software project.",

    "description" : "This OpenFabrics Alliance (OFA) OpenSM routing engine module provides credit-loop-free routing while supporting two quality of service (QoS) levels for an InfiniBand fabric with a 3D torus topology. In addition it is able to route around multiple failed fabric links or a single failed fabric switch without introducing credit loops, and without changing path Service Level (SL) values granted before the failure.This OFA OpenSM routing engine module improves the operational characteristics of a parallel computer built using an InfiniBand fabric with a 3D torus topology. By providing two QoS levels, it allows system administrators to prevent application interprocess communication and file system communication from impacting each other. By providing the capability to route traffic around failed fabric components, it enables repair of failed components without impacting jobs running on the computer system.",

Cyclooctane conformation space was represented using points in 72 dimensions (3 coordinates for each molecule). The code was used to triangulate the point cloud and thereby study the geometry and topology of cyclooctane. Futures applications are envisioned for peptides and proteins.",

The approach taken is designed to; preserve and leverage any important specialized algorithms and/or functionality an existing application may provide; minimize the requirements barrier for an application to participate; and work within advanced solver frameworks (e.g. as extensions to the Trilinos/NOX nonlinear solver libraries, PETSc, . . .). Of note is that components/physics codes that can be coupled within LIME are NOT limited to: components written in one particular language; a particular numerical discretization approach ( e.g. Finite Element); or physical models expressed as PDE's.",

Data acquisition modules, such as ADCs, TDC, Scalers, can be loaded into the system, or removed easily. The GUI allows users to activate modules, and channels within modules by clicking on icons. Running configurations are stored; data are collected and can be viewed either as raw numbers, or by charts and histograms that update as the data are accumulated.

    "description" : "PERM is a C library for persistent heap management and is intended for use with a dynamic-memory allocator (e.g. malloc, free). The PERM memory allocator replaces the standard C dynamic memory allocation functions with compatible versions that provide persistent memory to application programs. Memory allocated with the PERM allocatory will persist between program invocations after a call to a checkpoint function. This function essentially saves the state of the heap and registered global variables to a file which may reside in flash memory or other node local storage. A few other functions are also provided by the library to manage checkpoint files. Global variables in an application can be marked persistent and be included in a checkpoint by using a compiler attribute defined as PERM. The PERM checkpoint methof is not dependent on the programming model ans works with distributed memory or shared memory programs.",

    "description" : "GeoTess facilitates access to a multi-level triangular tessellation of a unit sphere, including find the index of the triangle in which an arbitrary position on the sphere resides and computing the interpolation coefficients that should be applied to data stored on the nodes of the tessellation that defines the triangle. It is very common for Earth scientists to store values of various Earth properties on a grid that spans the globe. For convenience, they almost always choose a grid which is evenly spaced in both latitude and longitude over the surface of the globe. While these grids are evenly spaced in latitude-longitude coordinates, they are in reality very unevenly spaced when cell size is evaluated in square km since lines of longitude converge at the poles. Tessellations consisting of a set of approximately equal area triangles that span the globe are much more efficient way to impose a grid onto the surface of a sphere. The GeoTess software facilitates interacting with a triangular tessellation of a sphere and could significantly increase the efficiency of Earth science software codes. The code can construct variable resolution triangular tessellations. It can also load a previously constructed tessellation from an input file and implements a \"walking triangle\" search algorithm to find the index of the triangle on the tessellation that contains a user specified point of interest. It also computes the interpolation coefficients that should be applied to data stored on the nodes of the containing triangle",

For the characterization of uncertainties, Bayesian inference tools are provided to infer uncertain model parameters, as well as Bayesian compressive sensing methods for discovering sparse representations of high-dimensional input-output response surfaces, and also Karhunen-Lo猫ve expansions for representing stochastic processes. Uncertain parameters are treated as random variables and represented with Polynomial Chaos expansions (PCEs). The library implements several spectral basis function types (e.g. Hermite basis functions in terms of Gaussian random variables or Legendre basis functions in terms of uniform random variables) that can be used to represent random variables with PCEs. For propagation of uncertainty, tools are provided to propagate PCEs that describe the input uncertainty through the computational model using either intrusive methods (Galerkin projection of equations onto basis functions) or non-intrusive methods (perform deterministic operation at sampled values of the random values and project the obtained results onto basis functions).",

The rotor is treated as a rotating rigid body, such that structural dynamical motions are not modeled. The turbine is assumed to operate within a steady, but possibly sheared, wind or current velocity. For marine hydrokinetic energy applications, the presence of a river/tidal channel bed and water surface boundaries may be modeled.",

It has also been applied in the detection of algal pathogens, when algal biofuel ponds became unproductive. RAPTOR first trims and filters genomic sequence reads based on quality and related considerations, then performs a quick alignment to the human (or other host) genome to filter out host sequences, then performs a deeper search against microbial genomes. Alignment to a protein sequence database is optional. Alignment results are summarized and placed in a taxonomic framework using the Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm.",

    "description" : "This package implements an optimal-scaling multigrid solver for the (non) linear systems that arise from the discretization of problems with evolutionary behavior. Typically, solution algorithms for evolution equations are based on a time-marching approach, solving sequentially for one time step after the other. Parallelism in these traditional time-integrarion techniques is limited to spatial parallelism. However, current trends in computer architectures are leading twards system with more, but not faster. processors. Therefore, faster compute speeds must come from greater parallelism. One approach to achieve parallelism in time is with multigrid, but extending classical multigrid methods for elliptic poerators to this setting is a significant achievement. In this software, we implement a non-intrusive, optimal-scaling time-parallel method based on multigrid reduction techniques. The examples in the package demonstrate optimality of our multigrid-reduction-in-time algorithm (MGRIT) for solving a variety of parabolic equations in two and three sparial dimensions. These examples can also be used to show that MGRIT can achieve significant speedup in comparison to sequential time marching on modern architectures.",

    "description" : "ThermoPhonon is a stand-alone code, which can be integrated into other software packages. Typically, it is used together with a density functional theory (DFT) code (such as VASP, Wien2k, AbInit, SIESTA) and a phonon code (such as Phonopy or Phon). The workflow is the following. Molecular dynamics (MD) in a supercell at a given temperature T is performed using another code. After sufficient equilibration, the output in the form of atomic positions and forces for a large number of selected MD steps is recorded into a file. If needed, one can modify this file by applying additional constraints, such as enforced crystal symmetry or subtracted motion of the center of mass. ThermoPhonon reads the file with atomic positions and forces and writes a new file with the force constants. Force constants can be used by another code (such as Phonopy or Phon) to produce phonon spectrum for plotting, in the assumption of known equilibrium atomic positions provided in a separate file.",

    "description" : "The software is used to fit models of emission fields (e.g., fossil-fuel CO2 emissions) to sparse measurements of gaseous concentrations. Its primary aim is to provide an implementation and a demonstration for the algorithms and models developed in J. Ray, V. Yadav, A. M. Michalak, B. van Bloemen Waanders and S. A. McKenna, \"A multiresolution spatial parameterization for the estimation of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emissions via atmospheric inversions\", accepted, Geoscientific Model Development, 2014. The software can be used to estimate emissions of non-reactive gases such as fossil-fuel CO2, methane etc. The software uses a proxy of the emission field being estimated (e.g., for fossil-fuel CO2, a population density map is a good proxy) to construct a wavelet model for the emission field. It then uses a shrinkage regression algorithm called Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP) to fit the wavelet model to concentration measurements, using an atmospheric transport model to relate emission and concentration fields. Algorithmic novelties described in the paper above (1) ensure that the estimated emission fields are non-negative, (2) allow the use of guesses for emission fields to accelerate the estimation processes and (3) ensure that under/overestimates in the guesses do not skew the estimation.",

    "description" : "Genomic islands are key mobile DNA elements in bacterial evolution, that can distinguish pathogenic strains from each other, or distinguish pathogenic strains from non-pathogenic strains. Their detection in genomes is a challenging problem. We present 3 main software components that attack the island detection problem on two different bases: 1) the preference of islands to insert in chromosomal tRNA or tmRNA genes (islander.pl), and 2) islands' sporadic occurrence among closely related strains. The latter principle is employed in both an algorithm (learnedPhyloblocks.pl) and a visualization method (panGenome.pl). Component islander.pl finds islands based on their preference for a particular target gene type. We annotate each tRNA and tmRNA gene, find fragments of each such gene as candidates for the distal ends of islands, and filter candidates to remove false positives. Component learnedPhyloblocks.pl uses islands found by islander.pl and other methods as a training set to find new islands. Reference genomes are aligned using mugsy, then the \"phylotypes\" or patterns of occurrence in the reference set are determined for each position in the target genome, and those phylotypes most enriched in the training set of islands are followed to detect yet more islands. Component panGenome.pl produces a big-data visualization of the chromosomally-ordered \"pan-genome\", that includes every gene of every reference genome (x-axis, pan-genome order; y-axis, reference genomes; color-coding, gene presence/absence etc.), islands appearing as dark patches.",

Possible applications include application to energy balance models, ice sheet modeling, and avalanche forecasting. The model implements physics from published, peer-reviewed articles. The main purpose is to foster university and laboratory collaboration to build a larger multi-scale snow model using MOOSE. The main feature of the code is that it is implemented using the MOOSE framework, thus making features such as multiphysics coupling, adaptive mesh refinement, and parallel scalability native to the application. PIKA implements three equations: the phase-field equation for tracking the evolution of the ice-air interface within seasonal snow at the grain-scale; the heat equation for computing the temperature of both the ice and air within the snow; and the mass transport equation for monitoring the diffusion of water vapor in the pore space of the snow.",

It also provides a modular, flexible software development architecture that scientists can use to generate C, Python, and IDL source code templates that embed the pre and post processing logic allowing the scientist to focus on only their science. The input data, preprocessing, and output data specifications of algorithms are defined through a graphical interface and stored in a database. ADI implements workflow for data integration and supports user access to data through a library of software modules. Data preprocess capabilities supported include automated retrieval of data from input files, merging the retrieved data into appropriately sized chunks, and transformation of the data onto a common coordinate system grid. Through the graphical interface, users can view the details of both their data products and those in the ARM catalog and allows developers to use existing data product to build new data products. Views of the output data products include an overlay of how the design meets ARM archive's data standards providing the user with a visual cue indicating where their output violates an archive standard. The ADI libraries access the information provided through the GUI via a Postgres database. The ADI framework and its supporting components can significantly decrease the time and cost of implementing scientific algorithms while improving the ability of scientists to disseminate their results.",

    "description" : "Physical device safety is typically implemented locally using embedded controllers, while operations safety is primarily performed in control centers. Safe operations can be enhanced by correct design of device-level control algorithms, and protocols, procedures and operator training at the control-room level, but all can fail. Moreover, these elements exchange data and issue commands via vulnerable communication layers. In order to secure these gaps and enhance operational safety, we believe monitoring of command sequences must be combined with an awareness of physical device limitations and automata models that capture safety mechanisms. One way of doing this is by leveraging specification-based intrusion detection to monitor for physical constraint violations. The method can also verify that physical infrastructure state is consistent with monitoring information and control commands exchanged between field devices and control centers. This additional security layer enhances protection from both outsider attacks and insider mistakes. We implemented specification-based SCADA command analyzers using physical constraint algorithms directly in the Bro framework and Broccoli APIs for three separate scenarios: a water heater, an automated distribution system, and an over-current protection scheme. To accomplish this, we added low-level analyzers capable of examining control system-specific protocol packets for both Modbus TCP and DNP3, and also higher-level analyzers able to interpret device command and data streams within the context of each device's physical capabilities and present operational state. Thus the software that we are making available includes the Bro/Broccoli scripts for these three scenarios, as well as simulators, written in C, of those scenarios that generate sample traffic that is monitored by the Bro/Broccoli scripts. In addition, we have also implemented systems to directly pull cyber-physical information from the OSIsoft PI historian system. We have included the Python scripts used to perform that monitoring.",

    "description" : "The ISDDD software program simulates a mathematical model, named ISD3 (\"ISDDD\"), developed for describing the time-, concentration- and particle size- dependent dissolution of particles, their delivery to cells, and the delivery and uptake of ions to cells in in vitro liquid test systems. The model is based on a specific formulation of the Population Balance Equation, derived for soluble particles. ISD3 solves for the size and spatial distribution of particle numbers, represented together as a particle number density (that is a function of particle location and diameter). From the number density, all other quantities, such as mass, concentration, size distribution and surface areas are derived. The model can be applied for any initial particle size distribution data by representing the data in terms of the number density. As a result, time dependent solutions can be obtained for all size ranges in a single run of the ISD3 simulation for a given particle type and\nmedia conditions. In the current implementation, particles are treated as spherical in shape and can be modeled as primary particles, agglomerates, or as primary particles coated with proteins. Ions are modeled as a lumped system with a uniform concentration in the liquid media. Particle transport is assumed to occur down the liquid column via diffusion and sedimentation (no fluid convection), and no aggregation/agglomeration, coagulation and break-up of the particles occur during transport. Cellular uptake kinetics of ions and particle dissolution kinetics are currently implemented using empirical models that were developed and calibrated for silver nanoparticles and ions. The ISD3 code is modular, allowing use of the existing equations for the dissolution model and ion uptake, but can be modified to include alternate models developed by the user. Application of ISD3 to another particle system would involve inputting parameters appropriate for the particles and model system. For particle uptake by cells, users have the option to use a no-flux or a perfectly absorbing 鈥榮ticky鈥� boundary condition. For reactive boundary conditions, the user needs to modify a few lines of the code to express the desired form of the boundary condition (e.g., Robin type of boundary condition).",

    "description" : "Some of the most pressing machine learning applications such as cyber security and object recognition lack enough ground-truth training data to build a classifier. We solve this problem by using unsupervised deep learning techniques to determine when data were anomalous or deviated from the norm. Traditional methods require either specific context dependent expertise to construct models, or prior examples of events and large amounts of well-labeled data to perform machine learning. Some cutting-edge deep learning approaches have been used to characterize complex events, but these have not been applied to the streaming environment and require a great deal of data. We demonstrated the use of an autoencoder and relevant featurization techniques to both learn a feature space and then identify anomalous portions  without the aid of labeled data or domain knowledge. In this way, we demonstrated the detection of anomalous features without domain knowledge or tagged examples, and delivered these features to users.",

    "description" : "CodeVision (formerly MassAV) is a malware analysis workflow system and repository. It began as a simple tool for analyzing a large malware corpus using multiple COTS antivirus engines in parallel. It has since evolved into a unified interface for collecting, storing and analyzing malicious executable code using a variety of COTS and GOTS backends.  Not only can CodeVision receive samples from users via its command-line and web interfaces, but it can also operate on continuous network data feeds (e.g., perimeter e-mail attachments, HTTP downloads). The modular analysis  framework and simple API give developers the ability to integrate custom and off-the-shelf analysis tools with ease. The system manages scheduling and dependencies, allowing modules to be chained together into analysis-driven workflows. The system is designed as a distributed, load-balanced web service, an architecture that allows it to scale horizontally by adding additional nodes.",

The interactions between the model's components are graph-rewriting rules that denote the minimum context needed for the interaction to occur.  In some cases the context required for reactions to occur can grow quite large, and the lengthy textual description of the interaction can be difficult to interpret or debug. RuleBuilder is designed to make this process simpler through visualization of individual rule or pattern strings.  The software assists in the reading of existing models by converting the BNGL strings of interest into a graph-based representation composed of nodes and edges.

Also, it is not intended for thermodynamic model development or for constructing phase diagrams. The main purpose of the software is to be directly coupled with a multi-physics code to provide material properties and boundary conditions for various physical phenomena. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to enhance computational performance through advanced algorithm development, such as improved estimation techniques and non-linear solvers. Various useful parameters can be provided as output from Thermochimica, such as: determination of which phases are stable at equilibrium, the mass of solution species and phases at equilibrium, mole fractions of solution phase constituents, thermochemical activities (which are related to partial pressures for gaseous species), chemical potentials of solution species and phases, and integral Gibbs energy (referenced relative to standard state). The overall goal is to provide an open source computational tool to enhance the predictive capability of multi-physics codes without significantly impeding computational performance.",

    "description" : "paws stands for the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL. It was conceived to serve as a lean and modular workflow manager for image-like data. While there are many Python packages providing for a wide variety of processing tasks, we are often faced with a need to bring several packages together, and then to add some home-built scripts as well, to complete a data processing workflow. paws was designed to make this process easy, by providing interfaces to an ever-growing number of existing packages and providing easy ways for users to add their own operations. Occasionally, we have need of an operation that is not provided by a Python package that we know of. In these rare cases, we have developed original operations within PAWS, but such operations intend to live in a lower-level package as soon as they are mature.",

    "description" : "Here, we present the implementation of a Bayesian model (BP-Quant) that uses statistically derived peptides signatures to identify peptides that are outside the dominant pattern, or the existence of multiple over-expressed patterns to improve relative protein abundance estimates. It is a research-driven approach that utilizes the objectives of the experiment, defined in the context of a standard statistical hypothesis, to identify a set of peptides exhibiting similar statistical behavior relating to a protein. This approach infers that changes in relative protein abundance can be used as a surrogate for changes in function, without necessarily taking into account the effect of differential post-translational modifications, processing, or splicing in altering protein function. BP-Quant is available as MatLab 庐 and R packages here.",

First is the source code (js) for a website created to display collision cross section data for metabolites and other small molecules. The second is the underlying CCS dataset. The growing interest in metabolomic and exposomic studies is also inciting a need for new techniques to analyze these diverse molecules. Mass spectrometry-based studies are often preferred for the confident identification of small molecules. Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) is capable of separating molecules that have the same m/z but different conformational arrangements, which is very useful in metabolomic and exposomic analyses. As the desire for IMS measurements of metabolites continues to grow, so does the need for high quality collision cross section (CCS) values.",

Rubble is often detectable in images with submeter resolution, and can indicate damage to structures from high winds or earthquakes.

The mask can be used in a geospatial software application like ArcMap to generate a damage map based on the rubble density. The rubble detection mask will contain some false positives which are usually more isolated than true rubble, so a density map will provide a more accurate indication of affected areas than the indivdidual rubble detections will.",

    "description" : "The goal of Computational Simulation of Online Social Behavior (SocialSim) is to develop innovative technologies for highfidelity computational simulation of online social behavior. SocialSim will focus specifically on information spread and evolution. Current computational approaches to social and behavioral simulation are limited in this regard. Top-down simulation approaches focus on the dynamics of a population as a whole, and model behavioral phenomena by assuming uniform or mostly-uniform behavior across that population. Such methods can easily scale to simulate massive populations, but can be inaccurate if there are specific, distinct variations in the characteristics of the population. In contrast, bottom-up simulation approaches treat population dynamics as an emergent property of the activities and interactions taking place within a diverse population. While such approaches can enable more accurate simulation of information spread, they do not readily scale to represent large populations. SocialSim aims to develop novel approaches to address these challenges.",

    "description" : "The numerical background of the FEHM computer code can be traced to the early 1970s when it was used to simulate geothermal and hot dry rock reservoirs. The primary use over a number of years was to assist in the understanding of flow fields and mass transport in the saturated and unsaturated zones below the potential Yucca Mountain repository. Today FEHM is used to simulate groundwater and contaminant flow and transport in deep and shallow, fractured and un-fractured porous media throughout the US DOE complex. FEHM has proved to be a valuable asset on a variety of projects of national interest including Environmental Remediation of the Nevada Test Site, the LANL Groundwater Protection Program, geologic CO2 sequestration, Enhanced Geothermal Energy (EGS) programs, Oil and Gas production, Nuclear Waste Isolation, and Arctic Permafrost. Subsurface physics has ranged from single fluid/single phase fluid flow when simulating basin scale groundwater aquifers to complex multifluid/ multi-phase fluid flow that includes phase change with boiling and condensing in applications such as unsaturated zone surrounding nuclear waste storage facility or leakage of CO2/brine through faults or wellbores. The numerical method used in FEHM is the control volume method (CV) for fluid flow and heat transfer equations which allows FEHM to exactly enforce energy/mass conservation; while an option is available to use the finite element (FE) method for displacement equations to obtain more accurate stress calculations. In addition to these standard methods, an option to use FE for flow is available, as well as a simple Finite Difference scheme.",

The input-output pairs are used in a Bayesian scheme to estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process based regression model that learns the input-output relationship.

    "description" : "Phase Field Dislocation Dynamics (PFDD) is a phase field approach for tracking the motion and interactions of individual dislocations in materials, mostly face-centered cubic (fcc) metals. The phase field approach relies on scalar order parameters or phase field variables to track a quantity of interest. In PFDD, these phase field variables represent the passage of perfect dislocations across each active slip system, with one order parameter defined in each slip system. Partial dislocations are represented with linear combinations of the order parameters. The system is evolved through minimization of the total system energy, which is directly dependent on the phase field variables. All of the physics is described by the total energy functional that is derived from a thermodynamic basis, and the system kinetics are evolved using a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation.",

    "description" : "The software is an analyzer for automated sandbox analysis of malware on the OS X operating system. It runs inside an OS X virtual machine to collect data about what happens when a given file opened or run. As of August 2014, there was no sandbox software for Mac OS X malware, as it requires different methods from those used on the Windows OS (which most sandboxes are written for). This software adds OS X analysis capabilities to an existing open-source sandbox, Cuckoo Sandbox (https://cuckoosandbox.org/), which previously only worked for Windows. \n\nThe analyzer itself can take many different types of files as input: the traditional Mach-O and FAT executables, .app files, zip files, Python scripts, Java archives, and web pages, as well as PDFs and other documents. While the file is running, the analyzer also simulates rudimentary human interaction with clicks and mouse movements in order to bypass the tests some malware use to see if they are being analyzed. The analyzer outputs several different kinds of data: functions call traces, network captures, screenshots, and all created and modified files. This work also includes a static analysis Cuckoo module for Mach-O binary files. It extracts file structures, code library imports and exports, and signatures. This data can be used along with the analyzer results to create signatures for malware.  ",

Derivatives are used to construct hyperbolic partlal differential equation (PDE) operators, namely gradient, divergence, Laplacian, and curl operators. \n5. Solution Method:\nThe library provides a python Interface which facilitates problem setup and description. However, the core solver Is written in the fortran 90 language. The solver couples MPI communication and linear solves together so that a direct (non-iterative) solution to the linear system of equations can be computed with minimal communication. Domain decomposition is limited to a uniform data size but provides perfect load balancing. \n6. Computer for which the code Is written:",

    "description" : "STAT is a light weight debugging tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes in a parallel application. STAT uses the MRNet tree based overlay network to broadcast commands from the tool front-end to the STAT daemons and for the front-end to gather the traces from the STAT daemons. As the traces propagate through the MRNet network tree, they are merged across all tasks to fonn a single call prefix tree. The call prefix tree can be examined to identify tuks with similar function call patterns and to delineate a small set of equivalence classes. A representative task from each of these classes can then be fed into a full feature debugger like TotalView for root cause analysis. ",

It was originally designed for task placement of adaptive mesh refinement codes (AMR). It is multi-objective in the sense that it simultaneously balances (potentially multiple types of) computational load on each rank as well as the communication traffic between the boxes. The heuristics used for mapping include algorithms such as greedy list assignment and space-filling curves, as well as algorithms from graph analysis such as adjacency matrix bandwidth reduction, recursive bisection, and greedy graph placement.",

    "description" : "The software was developed for the purpose of Microgrid Controller Procurement where multiple Microgrid Controller vendors were competing to prove the best performance. Each microgrid controller was connected to Real-Time Simulator (Opal-RT) where the Real-Time model of microgrid was simulated. Microgrid controllers were able to control most of the assets in the model. To be able to fairly compare controller's performance each controller was evaluated using exactly the same model, with the same initial conditions and exactly the same test sequence.\n\nThe microgrid evaluation test sequence lasted 100 minutes and consist of various grid disturbances to which a microgrid controller must respond. The microgrid and power system will experience multiple types of disturbances while performing dispatch functions.  Many functions are tested in grid-connected and islanded modes such as unexpended failures of generators, energy storage trip events, and large load fluctuations. The test sequence focuses on fault scenarios that cause the highest short-circuit fault current contribution; force a swing bus or generator capable of being a swing bus offline; cause the most reconfigurations; and cause conflicting objectives for the microgrid controller. \n\nDuring the test sequence execution multiple datapoints are being recorded and stored. During data postprocessing key performance parameters are extracted allowing quantitative comparison of performance on multiple aspects including: resiliency, fuel utilization, grid interconnection, ancillary services and power quality and eventually after summing all key performance parameters by comparing the overall result.\n\nTo be able to perform such testing multiple tools had to be developed included in this repository including:\n- Real time model of microgrid (Urban-Banshee, Remote-smaller model)\n- Test sequence configuration tools\n- Test execution real-time scripts\n- Post processing scripts\n- Human Machine Interface software",

    "description" : "The MGA8 (Multiple Group Analysis) program determines the relative abundances of plutonium and other actinide isotopes in different materials. The program analyzes spectra taken of such samples using a 4096-channel germanium (Ge) gamma-ray spectrometer. The code can be run in a one or two detector mode. The first spectrum, which is required and must be taken at a gain of 0.075 Kev/channel with a high resolution planar detector, contains the 0-300 Kev energy region. The second spectrum, which is optional, must be taken at a gain of 0.25 Kev/channel; it becomes important when analyzing high burnup samples (concentration of Pu241 greater than one percent). Isotopic analysis precisions of one percent or better can be obtained, and no calibrations are required. The system also measures the abundances of U235, U238, Np237, and Am241. A special calibration option is available to perform a one-time peak-shape characterization when first using a new detector system.",

    "description" : "XGC (X-point included gyrokinetic code), Version 3 Primary Author: Seunghoe Ku (PPPL, sku@pppl.gov), Robert Hager (PPPL, rhager@pppl.gov) 31 July 2017\nXGC is a gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code, which is sepeciallized in tokamak edge simulatin. The simulation domain can include the magnetic separatrix, magnetic axis and the biased material wall. XGC can run in full-f, total-delta-f, and conventional delta-f mode. The ion is kinetic always except ETG simulation. The electron can be adiabatic, fluid, drift kinetic, or gyrokinetic (for ETG).\nXGC is written in Fortran 90 and is designed for HPCs utilizing MPI, OpenMP, CUDA (GPU), OpenACC (GPU), and vectorization (Intel MIC-KNL). The weak scaling is roughly linear to the maximal nodes of leading HPCs in US.\nThere several versions of XGCs for different purpose: XGC0 is earlist version of XGC0 which is designed for neoclassical transport in the tokamak edge. It uses full-f method, and 00-mode electrostatic field is solved only. RMP and current response can be calculated with coupling with M3D.\nXGC1 is for turbulence simulation with low parallel wavenumber. Piecewise field following coordinates are used to handle low k-parallel perturbation with small (~64) number of toroidal resolution. In total-delta-f method, it utilizes phase space grid in addition to particles, to handel non-maxwellian distribution in the tokamak edge.\nXGCa is axisymmetric version of XGC1 to simulate neoclassical transport.\nReferences: [1] S.

However, the water-level data are typically affected by physical process unrelated to the aquifer pumping such as barometric pressure changes, tides, earthquakes, {\\etc}. We have developed a computational framework to correct for barometric and Earth tide effects using linear regression deconvolution, as an initial guess for a nonlinear residual minimization to account for pumping effects. The pumping effects are predicted using the Theis equation with initialization by Jacob's method. After minimizing the residuals between the observed data and Theis predicted pumping effects, the algorithm estimates storativity and transmissivity of the aquifer. The algorithm also provides   information about the measurement accuracy of the collected water-level data. The computational framework CHiPBETA is developed in Python and demonstrated to analyze synthetic and real data.",

    "description" : "New synthetic biology capabilities hold the promise of dramatically improving our ability to engineer biological systems. However, a fundamental hurdle in realizing this potential is our inability to accurately predict biological behavior after modifying the corresponding genotype. Kinetic models have traditionally been used to predict pathway dynamics in bioengineered systems, but they take significant time to develop, and rely heavily on domain expertise. This software implements a method to effectively predict pathway dynamics in an automated fashion using a combination of machine learning and abundant multiomics data (proteomics and metabolomics). The new method outperforms a classical kinetic model, and produces qualitative and quantitative predictions that can be used to productively guide bioengineering efforts. This method systematically leverages arbitrary amounts of new data to improve predictions, and does not assume any particular interactions, but rather implicitly chooses the most predictive ones.",

    "description" : "Curvallis is a plotting program written in Python using MatPlotLib to visualize and modify experimental equation of state data. It does this by plotting individual isotherms as lines. Data can be either 1d or 2d, meaning there can be 1 or many isotherms plotted at once. Data points on these lines can be moved around, and new points can be added or removed. 1d data can have different equations fitted to them, which best fit the data. These equations are currently only Nth degree polynomials and Equations of State, but any equation can be added. Manipulating data points causes this fitted line to be recalculated and redisplayed. The manipulated data points, as well as the fitted line, can be written to a file.\n",

It works by evolving an approximation function from a set of primitives. This makes it able to discover the form of the function, in addition to it's coefficients. It has even been shown to be able to discover natural physical laws from experimental data. Given that SR is one of the biggest success stories in genetic programming, it's surprising that there doesn't seem to be an easy-to-use, open-source SR program available. SoRa attempts to fill that gap. With SoRa any user should easily be able to provide experimental data and write a simple configuration file such that SoRa can find a set of good mathematical functions to match the data.\n",

In addition, they do not have in-house staff with expertise in building systems who can perform building retro-commissioning or identify energy efficiency improvement opportunities. \n\nThe solution to this problem is to develop a turn-key hardware/software solution (the RCx Sensor Suitcase) that can be used by non-experts to automatically generate low and no-cost energy efficiency rec commendations that will improve building operating costs, occupant comfort and building energy performance. \n\nThis is a joint project between Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, leading the development of the software and analysis elements, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), leading the development of the hardware and sensor elements with an associated table-based configuration support tool. The project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. \n\nThis software package was developed as a proof-of-concept prototype for the sensor suitcase software component. The software component was developed with a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which reads the sensor data and calls a MATLAB DLL to analyze the sensor data.",

    "description" : "Gkeyll v2.0 (also known as Gkyl, or G2) is a computational plasma physics code mostly written in LuaJIT, with time-critical parts written in C++. Gkyl contains solvers for gyrokinetic equations, Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and multi-fluid equations. Gkeyll contains ab-initio and novel implementations of a number of algorithms, and perhaps is unique in using a JIT compiled typeless dynamic language for its implementation.\n\nOne of the main innovations in Gkeyll is the blurring of boundaries between user written code (i.e. input files) and backend solver code. In fact, there is no difference: the front-end and back-end are written in the same programming language, opening up a very powerful way of composing simulations. All solver objects (grids, data-structures, updaters) can be queried, modified and controlled by the user, allowing complete control over the full simulation cycle. The use of the highly optimized Just-in-Time (JIT) compiled LuaJIT as the main programming language ensures that user written code remains highly efficient. Of course, core kernels can always be written in C/C++ and hooked in via LuaJIT鈥檚 powerful FFI facilities.",

    "description" : "NOVA is a suite of codes including the linear ideal eigenmode solver to find the solutions of ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system of equations, including such effects as plasma compressibility and realistic tokamak geometry. The kinetic post-processor of the suite, NOVA-K, analyses those solutions to find their stability properties. NOVA-K evaluates the wave particle interaction of the eigenmodes such as Toroidal Alfv茅n Eigenmodes (TAEs) or Reversed Shear Alfv茅n Eigenmodes (RSAEs) by employing the quadratic form with the perturbed distribution function coming from the drift kinetic equations.  In computations of the hot ion contribution to the growth rate NOVA-K makes use of the constant of motion to represent the hot particle drift orbits. \nNOVA is routinely used for AE structure computations and comparisons with the experimentally observed instabilities [M. A. Van Zeeland et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 135001 (2006), G. J. Kramer, Phys. Plasmas 13, 056104 (2006)]. The main limitations of NOVA code are caused by neglecting thermal ion finite Larmor radius (FLR), toroidal rotation, and drift effects for the eigenmode computations. Therefore it can not describe accurately radiative damping for example. Finite element methods are used in radial direction and Fourier harmonics are used in poloidal and toroidal directions.\n\nNOVA-K is able to predict various kinetic growth and damping rates perturbatively, such as the phase space gradient drive from energetic particles, continuum damping, radiative damping, ion/electron Landau damping and trapped electron collisional damping.

    "description" : "Pynamic is a benchmark designed to test a system's ability to handle the Dynamic Linking and Loading requirements of Python-based scientific applications. This benchmark is developed to add a workload to our testing environment, workload that represents a newly emerging class of DLL behaviors. Pynamic builds on pyMPI, an MPI extension to Python. Our augmentation includes a code generator that automatically generates Python C-extension dummy codes and a glue layer that facilitates linking and loading of the generated dynamic modules into the resulting pyMPI. Pynamic is configurable, enabling modeling the static properties of a specific code. It does not, however, model any significant computations of the target and hence it is not subjected to the same level of control as the target code. In fact, HPC computer vendors and tool developers will be encouraged to add it to their testing suite once the code release is completed. An ability to produce and run this benchmark is an effective test for validating the capability of a compiler and a linker/loader as well as an OS kernel and other runtime systems of HPC computer vendors. In addition, the benchmark is designed as a stress test case for code development tools. Though Python has recently gained popularity in the HPC community, its heavy DLL operations have hindered certain HPC code development tools, notably parallel debuggers, from performing optimally.\n",

    "description" : "Tango is a transport solver intended for coupling with codes that return turbulent fluxes. In many physics problems, including magnetically confined fusion plasmas such as a tokamak, a separation of timescales exists between the timescale of turbulence and the timescale for evolution of mean, macroscopic quantities such as density and temperature in response to turbulent fluxes. In the numerical simulation of such scenarios, it is desirable to efficiently exploit the separation of timescales. Furthermore, because in general the turbulent fluxes depend nonlinearly on the macroscopic quantities and their derivatives, certain numerical instabilities arise and special methods are required to handle them.\n",

Generally, training a network for neuromorphic hardware is challenging due to the discontinuity of the activation function.  Whetstone overcomes this challenge by using ever-closer continuous approximations of a threshold activation, modified during training time.  This allows rapid and consistent training for ultra-low powered neuromorphic hardware. ",

    "description" : "BELLA is a long-read overlapper and read-to-read aligner that exploits novel approaches for selecting reliable k-mer seeds for filtering and for detecting overlapping read pairs to reconstruct the whole genome. BELLA uses a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication for high-performance overlap detection and then performs pairwise alignment on the overlapping read pairs. BELLA can be built with different pre-existing aligners to use on each read pair, so precision rates are determined by those aligners. Our evaluations include real and synthetic datasets with varying size and complexity and include recall, precision, and running time. BELLA's overlap detection retains nearly all true alignments, with recall rates that exceed other aligners, yet it filters enough read pairs that the running time, including pairwise alignments, is closer to tools that only perform overlapping and is significantly faster than tools that also perform alignment",

This library implements the UPC-specific functionality, including shared-memory allocation and distributed locks. The network-dependent functionality is implemented as a thin wrapper around the separate GASNet (Global-Address Space Networking) library, which is required for operation. This software implements the \"Berkeley UPC Runtime Specification\", which is targeted by at least four separate UPC compiler front-ends. The implementation is highly portable and runs over hardware ranging from laptops to custom supercomputers. An external library is required for certain local memory allocation operations; a well-defined interface allows for multiple implementations of this library, but at present the \"umalloc\" library from LBNL is the only compatible implementation.",

    "description" : "Metamesh is a general-purpose C++ language library for creating data structures that represent meshes. An important difference between Metamesh and other \"mesh\" libraries is that Metamesh does not provide a specific mesh format, in the usual sense, or tools or a GUI by which users build specific meshes. Rather, it provides a mechanism by which mesh formats themselves can be built, based on their constituent parts and the relationships between them.Consider that a mesh in up to three space dimensions can, in principle, contain nodes (0d entities, or points), edges (1d entities), faces (2d entities), and cells (3d, or volumetric, entities). A node might be defined in terms of (x), (x,y), or (x,y,z) in Cartesian coordinates; or perhaps something else, in a different coordinate system. An edge is typically defined from two nodes; say, \"edge E goes from node A=(ax,ay) to node B=(bx,by).\" Faces can reasonably be defined in terms of nodes or edges, and cells in terms of nodes, edges, or faces. Note also that someone might wish to support general faces or cells, or only specific variants - say, triangular faces and tetrahedral cells, or quadrilateral faces and hexahedral cells. Or, perhaps, both triangular and quadrilateral faces (but no others), with prisms for each cell. Consider also that a mesh can have the same or a lesser dimension than that of its enclosing space. In 3d, for example, one could have a full 3d mesh, a 2d \"sheet\" mesh with no cells, a 1d \"parametrized curve\" with neither faces nor cells, or even a 1d \"point cloud.\" And, in addition to defining a mesh scheme, a user might wish to place additional data onto one or more mesh entities. Imagine, for example, a velocity at each node, a flux across each edge or face, and a mass or average density per cell. Metamesh supports all of this, through the use of C++ class and function templates, and template metaprogramming techniques. Programmers begin with constructs that Metamesh provides (or, users can define their own), and assemble them in particular ways in order to create particular mesh formats. Metamesh then provides functionality automatically to meshes that are constructed in this manner. Finally, Metamesh provides very general functions for spinning, extruding, visualizing, and performing input/output of whatever meshes a user builds with it.",

However, in many cases, and our HPC case in particular, we need a traditional file (POSIX) interface to this data as HPC I/O models have not moved to object interfaces, such as Amazon S3, CDMI, etc.Eventually Object Store providers may deliver file interfaces to their object stores, but at this point those interfaces are not ready to do the job that we need done. MarFS will glue together two existing scalable components: a file system's scalable metadata component that provides the file interface; and existing scalable object stores (from one or more providers).

    "description" : "Quinoa is a set of computational tools that enables research and numerical analysis in fluid dynamics. At this time it remains a test-bed to experiment with various algorithms using fully asynchronous runtime systems. Currently, Quinoa consists of the following tools: (1) Walker, a numerical integrator for systems of stochastic differential equations in time. It is a mathematical tool to analyze and design the behavior of stochastic differential equations. It allows the estimation of arbitrary coupled statistics and probability density functions and is currently used for the design of statistical moment approximations for multiple mixing materials in variable-density turbulence. (2) Inciter, an overdecomposition-aware finite element field solver for partial differential equations using 3D unstructured grids. Inciter is used to research asynchronous mesh-based algorithms and to experiment with coupling asynchronous to bulk-synchronous parallel code. Two planned new features of Inciter, compared to the previous release (LA-CC-16-015), to be implemented in 2017, are (a) a simple Navier-Stokes solver for ideal single-material compressible gases, and (b) solution-adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), which enables dynamically concentrating compute resources to regions with interesting physics. Using the NS-AMR problem we plan to explore how to scale such high-load-imbalance simulations, representative of large production multiphysics codes, to very large problems on very large computers using an asynchronous runtime system. (3) RNGTest, a test harness to subject random number generators to stringent statistical tests enabling quantitative ranking with respect to their quality and computational cost. (4) UnitTest, a unit test harness, running hundreds of tests per second, capable of testing serial, synchronous, and asynchronous functions. (5) MeshConv, a mesh file converter that can be used to convert 3D tetrahedron meshes from and to either of the following formats: Gmsh, http://www.geuz.org/gmsh, Netgen, http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/netgen-mesher, ExodusII, http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii, HyperMesh, http://www.altairhyperworks.com/product/HyperMesh.",

The UPC++ interfaces for moving non-contiguous data and handling memories with different optimal access methods are composable and similar to those used in conventional C++. The UPC++ programmer can expect communication to run at close to hardware speeds. \n\nThe key facilities in UPC++ are global pointers, that enable the programmer to express \nownership information for improving locality, one-sided communication, both put/get and RPC, futures and continuations. Futures capture data readiness state, which is useful in making scheduling decisions, and continuations provide for completion handling via callbacks. Together, these enable the programmer to chain together a DAG of operations to execute asynchronously as high-latency dependencies become satisfied.\n",

    "description" : "The DOE has funded Sandia National Labs (SNL) to develop an open-source modeling tool to guide the design and layout of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) arrays to maximize power production while minimizing environmental effects. This modeling framework simulates flows through and around a MHK arrays while quantifying environmental responses. As an augmented version of the Dutch company, Deltares鈥檚, environmental hydrodynamics code, Delft3D, SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM includes a new module that simulates energy conversion (momentum withdrawal) by MHK current energy conversion devices with commensurate changes in the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate.  SNL-Delft3D-CEC-FM modified the Delft3D flexible mesh flow solver, DFlowFM.\n\nThe Following is a description of Deltares鈥檚 open-source code Delft3D from which Delft3D-CEC is built upon.\n\n鈥淒elft3D is a world leading 3D modeling suite to investigate hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology and water quality for fluvial, estuarine and coastal environments. As per 1 January 2011, the Delft3D flow (FLOW), morphology (MOR) and waves (WAVE) modules are available in open source.\nThe software is used and has proven his capabilities on many places around the world, like the Netherlands, USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Venice, etc. The software is continuously improved and developed with innovating advanced modelling techniques as consequence of the research work of our institute and to stay world leading.\nThe FLOW module is the heart of Delft3D and is a multi-dimensional (2D or 3D) hydrodynamic (and transport) simulation program which calculates non-steady flow and transport phenomena resulting from tidal and meteorological forcing on a curvilinear, boundary fitted grid or spherical coordinates. In 3D simulations, the vertical grid is defined following the so-called sigma coordinate approach or Z-layer approach. The MOR module computes sediment transport (both suspended and bed total load) and morphological changes for an arbitrary number of cohesive and non-cohesive fractions. Both currents and waves act as driving forces and a wide variety of transport formulae have been incorporated. For the suspended load this module connects to the 2D or 3D advection-diffusion solver of the FLOW module; density effects may be taken into account. An essential feature of the MOR module is the dynamic feedback with the FLOW and WAVE modules, which allow the flows and waves to adjust themselves to the local bathymetry and allows for simulations on any time scale from days (storm impact) to centuries (system dynamics). It can keep track of the bed composition to build up a stratigraphic record. The MOR module may be extended to include extensive features to simulate dredging and dumping scenarios.\nFor over 30 years Deltares has been in the forefront of these types of combined morphological simulation techniques.鈥漒n",

The model accurately resolves dynamic gas flows through long pipes using a non-ideal gas equation of state. It can be used to provide optimal intra-day flow schedules as well as spatiotemporal economic values of natural gas while ensuring that pipeline hydraulic limitations, compressor station constraints, operational factors, and pre-existing shipping contracts are satisfied. The inputs to the code are a model of the pipeline system as well as time-series data that specify boundary conditions on the network and time-dependent constraints on the optimal control problem. The outputs are time-series data that provide an approximately optimal solution of flows, pressures, compressor settings, and sensitivities to the objective function.",

There are no private or protected interfaces and no proprietary information included in the source.\n\nAny and all future versions will limit themselves to implementing commonly available and well known primitives for compile-time manipulation of types.\n \nA new public github repository will be created to host the code independent of its current location in the raja repository, likely at github.com/llnl/camp. \n \n",

    "description" : "T2Well/ECO2N is a coupled wellbore and reservoir model for simulating the dynamics of CO2 injection and leakage through wellbores. It can be seen as an extension to standard TOUGH/ECO2N V2.0, and can be applied to situations relevant to geologic CO2 storage involving upward flow (e.g., leakage) and downward flow (injection). The new simulator integrates a wellbore-reservoir system by assigning the wellbore and reservoir to two different sub-domains in which flow is controlled by appropriate physical laws. In the reservoir, we model flow using a standard multiphase Darcy flow approach. In the wellbores, we use the Drift-Flux Model and related conservation equations for describing transient two-phase non-isothermal wellbore flow of CO2-water mixtures. The mass and thermal energy balance equations are solved numerically by a finite difference scheme with wellbore heat transmission to the surrounding rock handled either semi-analytically or numerically. The momentum balance equation for the flow in the wellbore is solved numerically with a semi-explicit scheme.",

    "description" : "ZebrafishBMD: A software tool to perform benchmark dose calculations using toxicity screening data of high-throughput zebrafish assays.\nHigh-content imaging of larval zebrafish behavior can be used as a screening approach to rapidly evaluate the relative potential for chemicals to cause toxicity. However, most statistical methods applied to these data transform movement values to incidence-based 鈥渉its鈥� and calculate lowest effect levels (LELs), which loses individual fish resolution of behavior and defies hazard ranking due to reliance on applied dose levels. We developed a parallelizable workflow to calculate benchmark dose (BMD) values from dynamic, high-content zebrafish behavior data that scales for high throughput chemical screening. To capture the zebrafish movement response from light to dark stimulus, we summarized time-dependent data using both area under the curve and the immediate change at the transition point into two novel metrics that characterized abnormal behavior as a function of chemical concentration. The BMD workflow was applied to calculate BMD10 values of 1,060 ToxCast chemicals for 24 zebrafish endpoints, including behavior, mortality and morphology.\nZebrafishBMD implements the BMD workflow and provides Matlab scripts to read the data (stored in a specific structure) from a .mat file, to calculate the behavioral endpoint values from movement versus time data, to construct concentrationresponse\ncurves, to perform curve-fitting, and to calculate BMD10 values.",

    "description" : "ECO2N V2.0 is a fluid property module for the TOUGH2 simulator (Version 2.1) that was designed for applications to geologic sequestration of CO2 in saline aquifers and enhanced geothermal reservoirs. ECO2N V2.0 is an enhanced version of the previous ECO2N V1.0 module (Pruess, 2005). It expands the temperature range up to about 300oC whereas V1.0 can only be used for temperatures below about 110oC. V2.0 includes a comprehensive description of the thermodynamic and thermophysical properties of H2O - NaCl - CO2 mixtures, that reproduces fluid properties largely within experimental error for the temperature, pressure and salinity conditions 10 掳C < T < 300 掳C, P < 600 bar, and salinity up to halite saturation. This includes density, viscosity, and specific enthalpy of fluid phases as functions of temperature, pressure, and composition, as well as partitioning of mass components H2O, NaCl and CO2 among the different phases. In particular, V2.0 accounts for the effects of water on the thermophysical properties of the CO2-rich phase, which was ignored in V1.0, using a model consistent with the solubility models developed by Spycher and Pruess (2005, 2010). In terms of solubility models, V2.0 uses the same model for partitioning of mass components among the different phases (Spycher and Pruess, 2005) as V1.0 for the low temperature range (<99oC) but uses a new model (Spycher and Pruess, 2010) for the high temperature range (>109oC). In the transition range (99-109oC), a smooth interpolation is applied to estimate the partitioning as a function of the temperature. Flow processes can be modeled isothermally or non-isothermally, and phase conditions represented may include a single (aqueous or CO2-rich) phase, as well as two-phase (brine-CO2) mixtures. Fluid phases may appear or disappear in the course of a simulation, and solid salt may precipitate or dissolve. Note that the model cannot be applied to subcritical conditions that involves both liquid and gaseous CO2 unless thermol process is ignored (i.e.,isothermal run). For those cases, a user may use the fluid property module ECO2M (Pruess, 2011) instead.",

    "description" : "With Exascale performance and its challenges in\nmind, one ubiquitous concern among architects is energy efficiency.\nPetascale systems projected to Exascale systems are\nunsustainable at current power consumption rates. One major\ncontributor to system-wide power consumption is the number of\nmemory operations leading to data movement and management\ntechniques applied by the runtime system. To address this\nproblem, we present the concept of the Architected Composite\nData Types (ACDT) framework. The framework is made aware of\ndata composites, assigning them a specific layout, transformations\nand operators. Data manipulation overhead is amortized over a\nlarger number of elements and program performance and power\nefficiency can be significantly improved.\n",

The user can select the NCG as being CO2, N2, or CH4. EOS7CA uses a cubic equation of state with a multiphase version of Darcy's Law to model flow and transport of gas and aqueous phase mixtures over a range of pressures and temperatures appropriate to shallow subsurface porous media systems. The limitation to shallow systems arises from the use of Henry's Law for gas solubility which is appropriate for low pressures but begins to over-predict solubility starting at pressures greater than approximately 1 MPa (10 bar). The components modeled in EOS7CA are water, brine, NCG, gas tracer, air, and optional heat.",

    "description" : "Lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments are often used in wind energy studies in place of meteorological towers, as they can collect measurements at higher heights than met towers and are more easily moved to different parts of a site. While lidars can accurately measure mean wind speeds, they frequently measure different values of turbulence intensity (TI) than would be measured by a cup anemometer on a tower. Discrepancies in TI values are caused by several factors, including instrument noise and volume averaging. The inability of lidars to accurately measure turbulence is a significant barrier to replacing met towers with lidars in the future. There is currently no accepted standard process for quantifying and removing these errors in lidar TI measurements.\n\nThe Software is an error reduction algorithm for lidar-measured turbulence.  The algorithm is trained using co-located lidar and meteorological tower data.  Lidar-measured parameters, such as wind speed, shear, and TI, will be used to predict the difference between the lidar- and tower-measured TI.  The algorithm will be disseminated as a set of computer code that can be used by lidar users and manufacturers to correct lidar TI data in real time or in post-processing.",

HYDRATE v1.5 needs the TOUGH+ v1.5 core code in order to compile and execute. It is written in standard FORTRAN 95/2003, and can be run on any computational platform (workstation, PC, Macintosh) for which such compilers are available. \nBy solving the coupled equations of mass and heat balance, the fully operational TOUGH+HYDRATE code can model the non-isothermal gas release, phase behavior and flow of fluids and heat under conditions typical of common natural CH4-hydrate deposits (i.e., in the permafrost and in deep ocean sediments) in complex geological media at any scale (from laboratory to reservoir) at which Darcy's law is valid. \nTOUGH+HYDRATE v1.5 includes both an equilibrium and a kinetic model of hydrate formation and dissociation. The model accounts for heat and up to four mass components, i.e., water, CH4, hydrate, and water-soluble inhibitors such as salts or alcohols. These are partitioned among four possible phases (gas phase, liquid phase, ice phase and hydrate phase). Hydrate dissociation or formation, phase changes and the corresponding thermal effects are fully described, as are the effects of inhibitors. The model can describe all possible hydrate dissociation mechanisms, i.e., depressurization, thermal stimulation, salting-out effects and inhibitor-induced effects.",

Up to 12 individual real gases can be tracked, and salt can precipitate as solid halite. The capabilities of the code include coupled flow and thermal effects, real gas behavior, Darcy and non-Darcy flow, several isotherm options of gas sorption onto the grains of the porous media, complex fracture descriptions, gas solubility into water, and geomechanical effects on flow properties. RealGasBrine v1.0 allows the study of flow and transport of fluids and heat over a wide range of time frames and spatial scales not only in gas reservoirs, but also in any problem involving the flow of gases in geologic media, including the geologic storage of greenhouse gas mixtures, the behavior of geothermal reservoirs with multi-component condensable (H2O and CO2) and non-condensable gas mixtures, the transport of water and released H2 in nuclear waste storage applications, etc.",

A funnel is generated around the reference curve and the other curve is checked to verify if it is inside the funnel. The funnel can be reshaped by setting a tolerance. One potential application is to verify the development of building HVAC control sequence, in which it compares data curves from real operation with data curves from simulation using developed control sequences, to verify if the developed control sequences have been implemented correctly. In addition, it can be used for Modelica library developer to do the unit test that verifies new model developments.",

Articulated splines are commonly used in the planetary stage of wind turbine gearboxes as the means of transmitting the driving torque while also improving load sharing.

For a given torque and shaft misalignment, Gear-SCouP quickly yields physical insights into relationships between the spline design parameters and resulting loads, bending, contact, and shear stresses, and safety factors considering various heat treatment methods. Results of this analytical model are compared well against several computational approaches under moderate misalignment.

    "description" : "TOUGHREACT is a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive non-isothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured media. The program is written in Fortran 77 and was developed by introducing reactive chemistry into the multiphase flow code TOUGH2 V2. Interactions between mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability, and can also modify the unsaturated flow properties of the rock.\nThe code is distributed with a comprehensive user's guide that includes sample problems addressing geothermal reservoirs and hydrothermal systems, nuclear waste isolation, groundwater quality, sequestration of carbon dioxide in saline aquifers, and supergene copper enrichment. The TOUGHREACT-Pitzer V1.21 package supports the following fluid property modules packaged into TOUGH2 V2.0 (CR-1574): EOS1, EOS2, EOS3, EOS4, EOS7, EOS9, and ECO2N. This version incorporates a Pitzer ion interaction model for application to saline solutions. It is NOT compatible with the most recent TOUGHREACT V2 and relies on the previous TOUGHREACT V1.21.",

PyBioNetFit will perform a series of calls to the BioNetGen simulator using different parameter sets, to identify the parameter set that best fits the data. The parameter search is dictated by the user's choice of one of several metaheuristic optimization algorithms, including differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, scatter search, and simulated annealing.

These include commercial formats such as CYME, Synergi, DEW, ePHASORSIM as well as open source formats such as OpenDSS and GridLAB-D. DiTTo consists of an API which represents electrical equipment, configurations, settings and timeseries data. This API acts as an intermediary between different distribution model formats. Several modules for reading and writing the models connect to this API to facilitate easy conversion between formats. Once feeder models are converted into the intermediate API, analysis can be done on the feeder using a network module. The modification module allows changes to be made to the model in the intermediate API. This allows a clear workflow that supports reading a model from one format, performing analysis, making modifications and writing the model to a different format.",

    "description" : "Building Energy Simulation Test (BESTEST) is an NREL-developed method to validate the qualitative performance of different whole building simulations engines relative to each other. \nhttps://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/old/6231.pdf\n\nFor EnergyPlus庐 and OpenStudio庐, generation of test cases, simulation, and reporting has been a manual or partially automated process that typically took a number of months after a new version of EnergyPlus came out. Building Energy Simulation Test - Generation Simulation and Reporting (BESTEST-GSR) was developed to fully automate this process so it is less error-prone, less time-consuming, and can be quickly run on request for any development branch of EnergyPlus and OpenStudio.\n\nThe initial use case is to directly support OpenStudio and EnergyPlus development, but the software is configured to support use by external software developers that build tools on top of EnergyPlus and/or OpenStudio. Tools built on top of OpenStudio can leverage the test generation, simulation, and reporting, while tools built on EnergyPlus can leverage the test simulation and reporting.\n\nThe model generation is accomplished by running OpenStudio measures for envelope, heating, or cooling test cases. At this stage the specified weather file required for a specific test case is assigned to the model. Simulation is enabled using the OpenStudio Command Line Interface (CLI) to run a series of OpenStudio and Reporting measures to a specified seed model. The specified workflow is defined with an OpenStudio OSW file. The first measure generates the test case model, while the second measure is a reporting measure that runs after the simulation to collect necessary simulation results from the EnergyPlus SQL file. The Reporting stage gathers data from individual OpenStudio OSW files and populates a series of BESTEST Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. BESTEST-GSR also gathers zip files from individual simulations for diagnostic purposes.",

    "description" : "The purpose of the ADAPT code is to generate Dynamic Event Trees (DET) using a user specified set of simulators. ADAPT can utilize any simulation tool which meets a minimal set of requirements. ADAPT is based on the concept of DET which uses explicit modeling of the deterministic dynamic processes that take place during a nuclear reactor plant system (or other complex system) evolution along with stochastic modeling. When DET are used to model different aspects of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), all accident progression scenarios starting from an initiating event are considered simultaneously. The DET branching occurs at user specified times and/or when an action is required by the system and/or the operator. These outcomes then decide how the dynamic system variables will evolve in time for each DET branch. Since two different outcomes at a DET branching may lead to completely different paths for system evolution, the next branching for these paths may occur not only at different times, but can be based on different branching criteria. The computational infrastructure allows for flexibility in ADAPT to link with different system simulation codes, parallel processing of the scenarios under consideration, on-line scenario management (initiation as well as termination), analysis of results, and user friendly graphical capabilities. The ADAPT system is designed for a distributed computing environment; the scheduler can track multiple concurrent branches simultaneously. The scheduler is modularized so that the DET branching strategy can be modified (e.g. biasing towards the worst case scenario/event). Independent database systems store data from the simulation tasks and the DET structure so that the event tree can be constructed and analyzed later. ADAPT is provided with a user-friendly client which can easily sort through and display the results of an experiment, precluding the need for the user to manually inspect individual simulator runs.",

    "description" : "Alfalfa is a web based software service that implements a virtual building control system using the EnergyPlus simulation as a backend. Conventional building energy simulation is non interactive, meaning that a simulation is started and run to completion without any user input during the simulation. Alfalfa allows a client to start a building simulation, then interactively read sensor locations and dynamically command actuators in realtime. \n\nThe Alfalfa web service conforms to the Project Haystack standard, which is a specification adopted by many building control system vendors. The service enables Haystack compliant control system vendors to test their control modules and algorithms without the need for a physical building or modifying their hardware and software, enabling faster and cheaper development cycles. \n\nAlfalfa has use cases beyond control system testing. One example is building fault detection, where physical building performance can be compared to simulated values in realtime, indicating where there may be a problem in the building. Another use case is informing predictive control systems, where near future events are simulated to premptively guide control decisions in the real building.\n\nThis software is web based and designed to be self service. Users of Alfalfa can upload an OpenStudio building model and begin communicating with the simulated building without any advanced setup or configuration, as if they were communicating a real building control system. Behind the scenes, Alfalfa makes extensive use of Amazon Web Services, in order to scale from a very small number of users and buildings, to extremely large numbers in a cost effective way. ",

In particular, we study the impact of one error (single- or multi-bit) on the execution of iterative methods. We use real life datasets from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection (https://sparse.tamu.edu) and widely used iterative solver library (Iterative Methods Library, IML++ v1.2a). We instrument the iterative solver implementations so that our error injection methodology can control the iteration, vector, position, number of bits and position of the bits of the error injection. We employed 6 solvers and 28 datasets, performed a total of 1,744,800 error injection runs and collected more than 2.5TB data. ",

These targeted systems are either matrices arising from discretized boundary integral equations, or frontal matrices in multi-frontal solvers for differential equations. ButterflyPACK relies on low-rank and butterfly formats under Hierarchical matrix, HODLR or HSS frameworks to compress, factor/precondition and solve the linear system in quasi-linear time. ButterflyPACK is particularly useful for large-scale ill-conditioned matrices arising from high-frequency wave equations involving multiple right-hand-sides. \n\nButterflyPACK is based on Fortran 2003, it also has interface written in C++. In addition, ButterflyPACK can be readily invoked from the software STRUMPACK. \n\nButterflyPACK supports hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming models.",

    "description" : "Paracousti simulates 3-D acoustic wave propagation in fixed (non-moving) complex media.  It solves the linear acoustic equations of motion using the velocity-pressure system of first order linear differential equations on a finite-difference Cartesian grid using Newton鈥檚 law of motion and mass continuity equations.  It also has the ability to incorporate acoustic attenuation to simulate non-recoverable energy losses via the velocity-memory-pressure system of linear differential equations.  We assume stationary, non-heat conducting, adiabatic media (fluid) where the background sound speed and material density are fixed in time.  Capabilities include massively parallel design, optimization for high contrast media interfaces, inclusion of arbitrary pressure and force sources defined by the user, inclusion of arbitrary pressure and velocity receivers defined by the user, acoustic wavefield snapshots in time for visualization, and convolutional perfectly matched layers to minimize artificial grid boundary reflections.  Paracousti was built upon the foundational framework of TDAAPS (Time-Domain Atmospheric Acoustic Propagation Suite) by Neill Symons, Dave Aldridge, and Leiph Preston. ",

    "description" : "The QuarkNet Data Acquisition (DAQ) circuit board is provided in a kit that includes a power supply, GPS capability with temperature sensor and cabling, and a USB link to the user鈥檚 computer. The DAQ circuit board has 4 analog discriminator inputs and produces trigger time and pulse edge time data for 1- to 4-fold coincidence levels. The DAQ then checks for user-defined trigger multiplicity across the four inputs. If the pulses satisfy the trigger requirement, the DAQ encodes time information for each input. Timing on the DAQ is done with a local clock synchronized to GPS time (via local module) once per second. This gives local times of nearly one nanosecond precision recorded with the accuracy inherent in GPS time. The DAQ kit is equipped to measure ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure; it also can determine its latitude and longitude from the GPS unit. A laptop or desktop computer connects to the DAQ via USB for control and collection of formatted raw data. ",

However, models may lack interpretability, are often overfit to the data, and are not generalizable to drug targets and chemotypes not in the training data. Benchmark datasets are prone to artificial enrichment and analogue bias due to the overrepresentation of certain scaffolds in experimentally determined active sets. Datasets can be evaluated using spatial statistics to quantify the dataset topology and better understand potential biases. Dataset clumping comprises a combination of self-similarity of actives and separation from decoys in chemical space and is associated with overoptimistic virtual screening results. This code explores methods of quantifying potential biases and examines some common benchmark datasets.",

Simulation code based on the Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) theory that effectively utilizes the parallel processing power provided by graphic processors and multicore processors. This constitutes a handy tool for experimentalists facing a massive flux of data, allowing them to accurately simulate the GISAXS process and analyze the produced data. The software computes the diffraction image for any given super position of custom shapes or morphologies in a user-defined region of the reciprocal space for all possible grazing incidence angles and in-plane sample rotations. This flexibility then allows to easily tackle a wide range of possible sample structures such as nanoparticles o top of or embedded in a substrate or a multilayered structure. In cases where the sample displays regions of significant refractive index contrast, an algorithm has been implemented to perform a slicing of the sample along the vertical direction and compute the averaging refractive index profile to be used as the reference geometry of the unpertubed system. Preliminary tests show good agreement with experimental data for a variety of commonly encountered nanostructures.",

SOFAST uses a large monitor or projection screen to display fringe patterns, and a machine vision camera to image the reflection of these patterns in the subject mirror. From these images, a detailed map of surface normals can be generated and compared to design or fitted mirror shapes. SOFAST uses standard Fringe Reflection (Deflectometry) approaches to measure the mirror surface normals. SOFAST uses an extrinsic analysis of key points on the facet to locate the camera and monitor relative to the facet coordinate system. It then refines this position based on the measured surface slope and integrated shape of the mirror facet. The facet is placed into a reference frame such that key points on the facet match the design facet in orientation and position. This is key to evaluating a facet as suitable for a specific solar application. SOFAST reports the measurements of the facet as detailed surface normal location in a format suitable for ray tracing optical analysis codes. SOFAST also reports summary information as to the facet fitted shape (monomial) and error parameters. Useful plots of the error distribution are also presented.",

    "description" : "(based on Erbilgin et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2017, 18:57). Mixed cultures of microbial species are increasingly used to carry out a specific task in lieu of engineering a single microbe to do the same task. However, knowing how different species' metabolisms will integrate to reach a desired outcome is a difficult problem that has been studied in great detail--but only using steady-state models. Mixed cultures used for biotechnology processes, as well as microbial communities that exist in nature and crop agriculture, are metabolically dynamic systems. Studying the temporal substrate utilization by individuals is individuals in mixed cultures is an important first step in developing approaches to better model these biochemical processes and microbial communities found in nature. \n\nThe 2017-004 software is comprised of four custom iPython notebooks that were used for all computational tasks in the experimental work described in \"Dynamic substrate preferences predict metabolic properties of a simple microbial consortium\" (Erbilgin et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2017). The results indicate that a significant portion of a model community's overall metabolism can be predicted based on the metabolism of the individuals. The results further suggest that, when the mixed culture's substrate depletion significantly deviates from such a prediction, this may highlight potential metabolic pathways affected by species-species microbial interactions, leading to hypotheses about how a particular microbial community's structure and function may be modulated to perform a particular biotechnological goal.",

    "description" : "\tWith the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to see that the readout of the human genome, spectacular milestone that it was, represents only the beginning of the \"omics\" information explosion. The technical side of the 'omics explosion--enabling researchers to efficiently readout terabytes of information spelling out whole genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes, does not per se provide a clear picture of how life works. Nor does it show us how we can engineer biology to solve the grand challenges of the 21st century: feeding 10 billion people with declining per capita supplies of arable land and clean water, sustaining biological diversity and slowing the increase in greenhouse gas formation, primarily carbon dioxide and methane. \n\nThe 2017-063 invention--Metabolites and Genes Integration Technology--proposes an integrated approach to correcting and connecting the dots of the 'omics explosion: linking genes to proteins, proteins to pathways, pathways to biochemical reactions and metabolites. The '063 invention is potentially transformational in that it can generate testable hypotheses across thousands of genes to predict their chemical and metabolic products. It can also do the reverse; i.e., starting from chemical and metabolic products it can generate testable hypotheses about which genes and pathways those molecules are linked to. Since we know that genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic databases are chock full or erroneous information, MAGI also has the unique benefit of correcting these errors through its own independent pathway of bidirectional hypothesis generation (genes=>proteins=>metabolites + metabolites=>proteins=>genes). Perfectly amenable to high-throughput hypothesis generation and experimentation, MAGI can transform our understanding of human, animal, plant and microbial biology over several decades, laying the essential knowledge foundation to addressing the grand scientific challenges of the 21st century.",

    "description" : "nSnare鈩� analyses and categorizes log messages generated by various and customizable third party software packages using a custom multi-tiered rules engine. Each log message is either determined to be a false positive, or it is assigned a score based on the severity of the potential attack and confidence that the activity described by the log message is not a false positive. Log messages are then assigned to an event, which is a collection of log messages related to a single potential attack. Meta-analysis rules run on the collection of all logs within an event to correlate multiple related logs into a single known attack signature. When the sum of the scores of all logs within an event exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the event is labelled as an attack and an automated response is generated to block the attacker from connecting to any protected resources, called quarantining within the application, for a variable length of time. The length of time that the quarantine lasts for is based on the severity and frequency of the attack, along with historical information on the attacker and any third party provided threat intelligence data that the system has gathered. An additional random length of time is added to each quarantine so the algorithm cannot easily be learned and bypassed by a persistent attacker. A confidence score is generated based on a proprietary algorithm that determines the likelihood that the data which lead to the attacker getting quarantined was a false positive. A threat intelligence record is created for each detected attack, with details on the attacker, a summary of what triggered the quarantine, the severity of the attack and the confidence the system has that the attack is not the result of false data, which can then be shared with external entities so that they can also protect themselves from a related attack.\n\nThe software also includes a web based front end for analyzing the current quarantined attacks, removing a quarantine in the case of a false positive, viewing previously quarantined attacks, and tracking suspicious activity that the system is currently evaluating. The web interface also allows the creation and modification of rules used by the rules engine, and the maintenance of a whitelist of known good systems that should never be automatically quarantined.\n",

    "description" : "Evaluating the effectiveness of data visualizations is a challenging undertaking and often relies on one-off human subject studies that test a visualization in the context of one specific task. Researchers across the fields of data science, visualization, and human-computer interaction are calling for foundational tools and principles that could be applied to assessing the effectiveness of data visualizations in a more rapid and generalizable manner. The visual saliency model for data visualizations described here addresses this need for evaluation tools. Visual saliency models assess the visual features (e.g. color, contrast, edges) of an image to predict which areas of that image will draw a viewer鈥檚 attention.  Providing predictions of where viewers will look in a visualization based on the saliency of the various regions and elements in that image could help designers to assess whether or not their design will draw the viewer鈥檚 attention as intended. The Data Visualization Saliency model, a saliency model for data visualizations, consists of two parts: a text saliency map and a modified version of the Itti, Koch and Niebur model [1]. The final saliency map is a linear combination of the two. The text saliency map is created from an algorithm that computes the likelihood of belonging to a text region for each pixel of an input visualization image. The modified Itti model transforms the original input image to a representation in CIE LAB color space, which provides an accurate representation of perceptual color opponency.\n\nFor a given input data visualization image, the Data Visualization Saliency model computes and returns the visualization saliency map highlighting areas of the data visualization that will draw a viewer鈥檚 attention. It also returns the lower level saliency maps for text and the modified Itti model.\n\n",

    "description" : "As systems and devices become virtualized and deployed in the cloud, the hypervisor becomes an increasingly appropriate place to collect performance data, system state, system landscape, function calls, transaction traces, and other characteristics. We developed a method by which an introspection application may be coupled with a hypervisor to 鈥渞each into鈥� the VM with minimal intrusiveness to collect data critical to the reconstruction of events, files, and operations. Such a capability is required to take advantage of the hypervisor as an instrumentation platform and to integrate that data with more traditional collection mechanisms. The concept of a VM serviced by a lightweight hypervisor is a relatively new paradigm for forensic practitioners. Traditional forensic techniques, based on assumptions that the filesystem was directly interacting with the hardware through an abstraction, afforded the forensic practitioner the assumption that there was nothing controlling the application below the filesystem. This is not the case when using virtualized technologies. Hypervisors can covertly monitor, introspect and interact with the guest in a transparent fashion. The problems of storage and collection of actionable data are exhausting. The current challenge is most hypervisors do not expose a useful application programming interface (API) at a sufficient level to do transparent, fine-grained and customizable introspection. Scalable VM instrumentation and introspection at an in-depth level requires fast handling of events, as well as direct access to VM state. Furthermore, deep introspection benefits greatly from the ability to gather data from the hardware during the VM鈥檚 exit to the hypervisor. All of this requires identical access to the system as the hypervisor itself; improper use of this ability could easily cause system instability. It is for this reason we believe that the hypervisor developers have been hesitant to grant this much control through their APIs. However, our approach leverages other means to collect and monitor the guests in a targeted fashion. Virtual machine introspection (VMI) is a technique used to monitor the runtime state of a system-level virtual machine. The runtime state can be may include processor registers, memory, disk, network, and any other hardware-level events\nA review of research literature and current VMI technologies exposed several limitations and tradeoffs in VMI approaches, including: the use of in-guest agents; kernel to user space transitions (dramatically slowing down processing); VMI tool pre-configuration requirements; hypervisor version lock-in or source code patching; reliance on operating system symbols; limited processor features due to hypervisor (even if the hardware could do more).\nTo address these constraints, a VMI tool was envisioned to provide the cloud forensic capabilities while having as few of these limitations as possible. The Kernel-based Virtual Machine Introspection (KVMi) tool was developed for hypervisors on Intel鈥檚 x86-64 architecture.

    "description" : "Synoptic is a system for graphical representation of real-time data in the Fermilab Accelerator Control System. It offers a means for domain experts to create, in a short time, coherent displays representing a machine or a process, along with actual readings from the control system indicating its current state. The displays can run either within a Java application, or in a conventional web browser as SVG images updated on the fly. Synoptic also optionally supports setting data back to the control system. The end users do not have to be familiar with programming, because displays are composed in a high-level graphical editor from preexisting building blocks: gauges, alarm indicators, static shapes, and such. Similarly, the runtime environment takes care of all internal 鈥減lumbing and wiring鈥� between components and hides the complexity of the actual data acquisition protocols.\n\nThe open-source Java Synoptic Toolkit includes a core of Synoptic, free of dependencies from the proprietary infrastructure. It can be used with any data acquisition system, providing that an appropriate data access interface is developed. The product can be customized in a variety of ways, for instance, by developing specialized components for rendering data.\n",

The tool integrates security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC), security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED), and automatic generation control (AGC) into one model. These are the three modes of power system scheduling that are used to meet the changing net demand. Each of these submodels have different time characteristics and are used to meet the changing demand at different time resolutions and horizons. This allows multiple timescales to be studied where FESTIV accounts for intertemporal coupling between each submodel and the submodels themselves. It does this while having different objectives between the submodels; commitment of resources, dispatch and reserve commitment, and finally control.",

    "description" : "H2OI95 is a stand-alone Fortran code for evaluating the IAPWS-95 equation-of-state model (Wagner and Pruss, 2002) for the thermodynamic properties of water. It further evaluates the corresponding thermochemical properties of water consistent with the CODATA recommendations (Cox et al., 1989). The IAPWS-95 model is based on a model equation for the dimensionless Helmholtz energy for which the primary variables are the inverse reduced temperature and reduced density. Here is the absolute temperature (K), is density (kg/m3), and the subscript refers to the critical point of water (647.096 K and 22.064 MPa pressure in this model, for which is 322 kg/m3). The code solves four basic types of problems, distinguished by the specified inputs: \n1, Temperature (K) and density (kg/m3) or reduced density\n2. Temperature (K) and pressure (MPa). \n3. Temperature (K) on the saturation (liquid-vapor equilibrium) curve \n4. Pressure (MPa) on the saturation curve\nEach type of problem is run using a corresponding input (text) file. All but the first type of problem require iteration. For example, to solve for desired temperature and pressure, the reduced density must be adjusted to give the desired pressure. Iteration is accomplished using the Newton-Raphson method, though the secant method is also used in solving the fourth type of problem. H2OI95 has been used to conduct numerical studies of convergence and the problem of multiple numerical solutions, only some of which correspond to valid results. Obtaining valid results depends mainly on appropriate choice of starting values. The default values in H2OI95 appear to consistently lead to generally desired results. With modification (not addressed here), H2OI95 can be used to support SUPCRT92 (Johnson et al., 1992) and similar codes that compute chemical thermodynamic properties of species and reactions over a wide range of temperature and pressure (273.16-1273K and 0-1000 MPa).\n",

    "description" : "Wind and solar generation is increasing rapidly in the USA and around the world and has the potential to replace carbon emitting generation. However, at high penetration, intermittent generation can present significant challenges because of increasing system variability and uncertainty. To manage these challenges, operation and planning procedures should incorporate additional analysis tools and methodologies. Particularly, tools are needed to help plan and operate the power system for maintaining intra鈥恉ay and intra鈥恏our balance between generation and load in power system鈥檚 balancing authorities. This tool addresses this problem by providing a way to plan for adequate amounts of balancing reserves for future years or seasons for expected wind and solar generation.  This is a user friendly tool to calculate ahead monthly required balancing reserves and the flexibility of scheduled\ngeneration to meet such requirements. This tool calculates reserves requirements of various types, such as day鈥恆head, load following and regulation, as well as estimates the capacity of the generation fleet to provide the required reserves. The estimations are based on utilities鈥� operational practices (such as forecasting, timeframe of reserve deployment), and it incorporates detailed synchronized variable and uncertain data from renewable generation and load. This tool uses a methodology that has been previously tested and applied to several systems: California Independent System Operator Corp., Columbia Grid, Northwest Power Pool, the Western Interconnection of the United States, and internationally in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama.

    "description" : "Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that enables all chemical species within a complex mixture to be resolved and identified based on their mass:charge ratio. MS is an increasingly important tool in life science research and development because it can resolve or separate small molecules, peptides, lipids, proteins, biopolymers and fragments of all of these structures. Unfortunately, the use of MS has been limited for lack of software tools to visualize, manipulate, store and transfer MS data. Ben Bowen, Oliver Ruebel and colleagues made a huge advance on the resolution of these limitations with the invention of \"OpenMSI\" (#2013-004), a computational method that makes the handling of these very large files (up to 50 Tb) much easier, especially for scientists with limited background in bioinformatics or sophisticated software applications of the type needed to handle such data files. \n\nWith the OpenMSI Arrayed Analysis Tool (OMAAT, #2016-188) invention, the authors take MS data analysis one step further by providing tolls for automatic sample position optimization and ion selection. Even though sample deposition technologies have improved greatly, there is always the chance of encountering outliers in a predefined roster, especially in very large sample sets. Manual curation of the data would be extremely time consuming, so the inventors have included an algorithm that automatically finds the outliers. OMAAT is written in Python with accompanying Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebook and is fully integrated with OpenMSI.",

The HE employs two methods to choose from when processing basin data: lumped (by basin) and distributed (gridded). Both methods can be evaluated using the built-in Kling-Gupta efficiency as a measure of model performance when compared to the outputs from the more complex GHM. Testing shows that the HE is 7 orders of magnitude faster then the widely used Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) GHM. ",

    "description" : "BNL NowCasting software is used in conjunction with multiple ground-based, upward looking, high definition imagers to predict available solar resources in the zero - 30 minutes time frame.  It takes HD images of the sky as input and conducts image pre-processing to correct image geometry, correct deformation caused by fish-eye lenses and remove extraneous parts of the image. It calculates the location of the sun and removes it to reduce distortion.   A cloud detection/tracking algorithm was developed using both spectral and spatial information for discriminating clouds and clear sky based on their shape, size, and color.  The software repeats the process with updated images generated every 30 seconds (or less) and then tracks the clouds as they move through the region of interest.  Cloud motion determination is based on finding the maximal normalized cross-correlation between sequential images.  The resolution of multiple imager views of clouds in the sky allows the system to estimate cloud height and categorize them into low or high cloud regimes that move at different rates. Additional input data on solar irradiance from pyranometers is ingested.  The algorithm then  determines the transmissivity of light and uses machine-learning techniques to predict the amount of available global horizontal irradiance (GHI) that will be available on the ground. Images from individual sets of cameras are stitched together to form regional forecasts that cover both generating facilities and distributed solar resources. The size of the nowcasting network is dependent on the number and location of imagers that are installed but has been demonstrated in an area up to 50 sq km",

    "description" : "While deep learning technologies for computer vision have developed rapidly since 2012, modeling of remote sensing systems has remained focused around human vision. In particular, remote sensing systems are usually constructed to optimize sensing cost-quality trade-offs with respect to human image interpretability. While some recent studies have explored remote sensing system design as a function of simple computer vision algorithm performance, there has been little work relating this design to the state-of-the-art in computer vision: deep learning with convolutional neural networks. We develop experimental systems to conduct this analysis, showing results with modern deep learning algorithms and recent overhead image data. Our results are compared to standard image quality measurements based on human visual perception, and we conclude not only that machine and human interpretability differ significantly, but that computer vision performance is largely self-consistent across a range of disparate conditions.\nThis repository contains all the code required to replicate the results of our research paper, and the corresponding docker environment in which that code can be executed. All code is written in Python3 and utilizes the PyTorch library (v1.0) for neural network model training and evaluation. Jupyter notebooks are used to visualize images transformed with our code, in addition to plotting experimental results. We also include the specific parameter files used to execute our experiments, with the intent that these experiments can be replicated.",

    "description" : "DEGAS 2 [1], like its predecessor, DEGAS [2], uses the Monte Carlo approach to integrating the Boltzmann equation, allowing the treatment of complex geometries, atomic physics, and wall interactions. DEGAS 2 is written in a \"macro-enhanced'' version of FORTRAN via the FWEB library, providing an object oriented capability and simplifying tedious tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation and the reading and written of self-describing binary files. As a result, the code is extremely flexible and can be readily adapted to problems seemingly far removed from tokamak divertor physics, e.g., its use in simulating the diffusive evaporation of lithium in NSTX [3] and LTX [4]. DEGAS 2 has been extensively verified, as is documented in its User's Manual [5]. Experimental validation has been largely centered on the Gas Puff Imaging (GPI) technique for visualizing plasma turbulence in the tokamak edge. The validation against deuterium gas puff data from NSTX is described in the paper by B. Cao et al. [6] Analogous work with both deuterium and helium has been carried out on Alcator C-Mod. A related application of DEGAS 2 is in the interpretation of data from the Edge Neutral Density Diagnostic on NSTX [7] and NSTX-U. DEGAS 2 has been applied to many other devices, including JT-60U [8], ADITYA [9], and FRC experiments at Tri-Alpha Energy [10]. Neutral transport codes are frequently coupled to plasma simulation codes to allow a self-consistent plasma-neutral solution to be computed. Initially, DEGAS 2 was coupled to UEDGE [11]. More recently, DEGAS 2 has been coupled to the drift-kinetic XGC0 [12], and has been used in the development and testing of the simplified built-in neutral transport module in XGC1 [13]. A related project is a DEGAS 2-based synthetic GPI diagnostic for XGC1 [14].\n\n[1] D. P. Stotler & C. F. F. Karney, Contrib. Plasma Phys. 34, 392 (1994)\n[2] D. Heifetz, D. Post et al., J. Comp.

    "description" : "Clean energy systems including the future power grid are enabled via the development, analysis and application of advanced simulation of complex systems based on large datasets.  The ability to handle and enable the simulation of complex systems allows researchers and analysts to address significant problems with greater confidence and greater levels of integrity.  Parallel execution of complex systems is paramount to addressing increasing complexity.  Programmatic interfaces for software configuration and parallel execution enable handling greater complexity and improving simulation integrity.  The Class Object Attribute Data (COAD) software is written as a programmatic interface to the PLEXOS dataset that enables the decomposition of the dataset in time and execution in parallel without loss of integrity.  COAD also enable the recomposition of solution datasets that are the output of distributed parallel execution of the core simulator.  ",

    "description" : "The main purpose of the software is to model energy use for individual and community scale solar water heating projects in California. \n\nUsage \n\nThe user provides a climate zone for a project, an occupancy for each household and whether any of the occupants stay at home during the day. The software can then load a set of example California specific hourly domestic hot water end-use load profiles from a database, size and locate the systems. The user can now simulate the hourly system performance over a period of one representative year, visualize and explore the simulation results using time-series plots for temperature profiles, heat and power rates, or look at annual summaries. Similarly the user can model individual household solar water heating projects and base case conventional gas tank water heater systems, such that the results can be compared between the individual, community and base case systems. \n\nThis functionality is readily available through a Jupyter notebook and a Django web framework, depending on what level of detail the user would like to access. \n\nFeatures \n\n- Python module to calculate solar irradiation on a tilted surface \n\n- Python module with simplified component models for Converter (solar collectors, electric resistance heater, gas burner, photovoltaic panels, heat pump), Storage (solar thermal tank, heat pump thermal tank, conventional gas tank water heater), and Distribution (distribution and solar pump, piping losses) components \n\n- Python module with preconfigured system simulation models for: base case gas tank water heaters, solar thermal water heaters (solar collector feeding a storage tank, with a tankeless gas water heater backup in a new installation cases and a base case gas tank water heater in a retrofit case) and solar electric water heaters (heat pump storage tank with an electric resistance backup) \n\n- Database with component performance parameters, California specific weather data and domestic hot water end-use load profiles \n\n- Django web framework to configure project, parametrize components and run simulation from a web browser \n\nThe package contains functional and unit tests and it is structured so that it can be extended with further technologies, applications and locations.",

It includes server-side components in the form of web services that provide analytical functions such as data clustering and temporal analysis.  The SRS client is accessed via a web browser and uses asynchronous javascript and XML (AJAX) to interact with and visualize the results of these web services.  Users of SRS can query data sources that are connected to the SRS backend, and query results are presented in the form of coordinated visual displays in a web browser that depict temporal, topical, and spatial relationships in the results.  SRS also includes an early stage graphical reasoning diagram interface that helps analysts express and test hypotheses.  \nThis software was developed with funding from the Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.",

    "description" : "Generating a CTF (thermal-hydraulics subchannel code) model can be time consuming and error prone because of the rigid formatting of the input file and the amount of input requirements. Because of the structured input format, making small changes to a model can require large scale changes to the input file. Furthermore, a user typically has to perform calculations to develop CTF input parameters from actual model geometry. Changing model geometry requires re-calculating input parameters and copying them from wherever the calculation was performed, be it a script, spreadsheet, or piece of paper. This process complicates the quality assurance process for that model and makes changing the model more difficult. CtfDeckBuilder is an object-oriented Python interface to CTF that allows the user to build a CTF model in Python. The user no longer needs to interface with the CTF input file when using the CtfDeckBuilder. The interface reduces the information required of the user by offering defaults for most modeling options provided by CTF. The user can perform calculations directly in Python when building the model so that calculations stay with the model itself. ",

    "description" : "There is a need for a way to simulate the heat transfer conditions for the entire layer of a build (both temperature and solidification gradient and velocity). CFD models could do this but those may take months to finish a simulation. The solution is an adaptive integration scheme for a analytic, conduction-only approach for a volumetric Gaussian heat source. Because this is analytic, it also allows increased functionality as well. 3DThesis can simulate heat transfer conditions for a volumetric Gaussian heat source moving in an arbitrary path at a point in time. This allows for the calculation of discrete snapshots of the temperature field or even the final solidification gradients and velocities.",

Geo T allows for simultaneous regression of multiple water chemical analyses, automatic reconstitution of deep fluids, and estimation of reservoir temperature from statistical evaluation of computed mineral saturation indices. The temperature estimation includes a \"best\" estimated temperature with its range of uncertainity. The computer program also outputs temperatures predicted using classical geothermometers. Input parameters include water composition and optionally, gas composition, dilution/evaporation factor (in case of boiling or mixing with dilute waters), and end-member water composition (in case of mixing with other non-dilute waters). This program was designed for geothermal applications but is also useful as a tool to quickly speciate a large number of water analyses.",

    "description" : "LATTE is a code used for computing the energy of, and forces acting on atoms in molecular materials using an implementation of the self-consistent charge tranfer tight-binding approximation. Advanced algorithms allow computational cost to scale linearly with the number of atoms, facilitating large-scale, long-duration molecular dynamics simulations of dynamic phenomena using an explicitly quantum mechanical method. Furthermore, these algorithms offer a straightforward path toward parallelization on multi-core/multi-processor and hybrid hardware architectures. Precise energy conservation in quantum-molecular dynamics is made possible via the extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics formalism. Medium and long-range interactions in molecular materials are described and bond-making and breaking events are tolerated via spin polarization. LATTE facilitates high-fidelity atomistic simulations of static and dynamic phenomena in condensed and gas phases where interatomic interactions are some combination of covalent, electrostatic, and van der Waals bonding. The main features of LATTE are implementation of concepts discussed in the scientific literature.",

The concept of a 'network operating system', a software layer that enables applications to get information about the network and to program it to meet its needs, has been around in academic papers for a while but appears to be feasible now due to the wide adoption of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. The SDN paradigm constitutes a network architecture that separates the control plane from the distributed data plane and provides logical centralization of the network control and state. These logical central control plane capabilities can be evolved to become the operating system through which the network policies are implemented across the entire network and applications can program network behavior.",

Existing task scheduling approaches are either heuristic or based on physical optimization algorithms, providing different speed and solution quality trade-offs. Physical Ising machines such as quantum and digital annealers have recently become available offering an alternative hardware solution to solve certain types of optimization problems. We propose an algorithm that allows expressing the problem in the compatible format. We present a domain specific partition strategy that enables to execute larger scale problems. TIGER - topology-aware task assignment mapper tool - implements the proposed algorithm and automatically integrates task- communication graph and an architecture graph into the quantum software environment.",

    "description" : "This program a new physical insight regarding efforts to evaluate electrochemical catalysts being developed for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. In particular, we ask: The methodology described here offers a solution to the problem of how to conduct Tafel analysis, which is used in determining electrocatalyst performance, in a quantitative manner, rather than through the qualitative guesswork it currently requires. This enables the measurement of electrocatalyst Tafel slopes and their associated parameters in a way that avoids the introduction of researcher bias, a problem to which current methods of Tafel fitting are prone. This procedure should significantly improve the ability of researchers working in the field of electrochemical energy conversion to rate and compare the catalyst materials being developed, advancing the characterization toolkit available to experimental electrochemists. \n\nThis work is born out of our general hypothesis that it should be possible to determine the proper regions for unambiguously fitting Tafel data by applying some set of physical constraints that link aspects of a Tafel plot to its corresponding J-V polarization curve. This algorithm applies such constraints and achieves the extraction of Tafel slopes in a wholly quantifiable and reliable fashion. Verification of this approach is achieved by pairing the theory with experiment, as the algorithm was tested using experimentally acquired data of three distinct, electrochemical reactions: platinum hydrogen evolution, iridium-catalyzed oxygen evolution, and platinum-catalyzed dioxygen reduction. For each of these cases, the algorithm predicts the same Tafel slope as those reported in long-established bodies of electrochemical literature, results suggesting the general applicability of this method for determining electrocatalyst Tafel slopes.",

GIDI handles and provides accesses to all forms of the GNDS nuclear data.\n\nFor multi-group data, GIDI provides functions to sum the data over all reactions. It also has functions for collapsing multi-group data to a small subset of groups and can transport correct multi-group data using the Pendlebury/Underhill formalism.\n\nThe GNDS definition supports data for a PROjectile hitting a TARget for a given Evaluation. In GIDI this is called a PROTARE. For example, a neutron hitting O-16 from the ENDF/B-VIII.0 evaluation.\n\nTo support a collection of protares, GIDI adds a Map class. The map class reads in a \"map\" file which specifies a list of projectile/target/evalaution's and their associated protare files. \n\nWith a map instance, a user can request a specific projectile/target/evaluation and the map instance will return the requested protare.",

    "description" : "Sina is a tool set for modern scientific data management that provides flexible, light-weight support of non-bulk data capture for retention in and queries against SQL and noSQL data stores. HPC simulations traditionally maintain their data in files.  Extracting data of interest for subsequent analysis then requires the time-consuming process of traversing directories and scraping data from files in a variety of formats. Sina facilitates capturing relevant data during execution or post-processing of simulation runs for retention in and queries from a modern data store.  The tools are sufficiently general to allow for the inclusion of new fields as scientists learn more about their data.  Libraries, currently in C++ and Python, and a command line interface (CLI) are provided.\nSina's flexibility starts with a general schema, in JSON, for the collection of non-bulk simulation data. JSON provides a flexible, human-readable representation of the data that of interest.  Sina currently has a C++ library for simulations to write data to and read from a schema-compliant file for subsequent ingestion into one of the supported data stores.  However, applications are free to write their data directly into a schema-compliant file.  Python packages provide data ingestion, management, query, and export capabilities.  A command line interface (CLI) provides simplified access to these features.  A common application programming interface (API) is used to maintain and query data in any of the supported data stores, which are currently limited to SQL and Apache Cassandra (a column store).  Tutorials, demonstrations, and examples illustrate aspects of the process using scripts and Jupyter notebooks.",

    "description" : "Unlike computer languages like C++ which has throw/catch, Python which has try/except and other newer computer languages, C has no built-in mechanism for handling exceptions (e.g., memory allocate failure or a divide by zero exceptions).\n\nWhile simple exception handling in the form of an integer parameter (e.g, errno) or an enum are often implemented in C programs, the richer types of exception reporting possible with newer computer languages are rarely implemented in C. \n\nThe statusMessageReporting package was created to facilitate rich exception reporting by C functions to their calling functions.\n\nThe statusMessageReporting (smr) package allows a function, called the generator, to communicate an exception to its calling function using a statusMessageReporting report. \n\nThe main parts of a report are:\n\n1)the level of the report called the status (valid levels are smr_status_Ok, smr_status_Info, smr_statusWarning and smr_status_Error)\n\n2) a string called the report's message and 3) two integer values, one representing the generator's ID, called the libraryID, and the other is the library's specific integer, called the code, that represents the type of exception the generator is reporting.\n\nThe code is similar to the errno for the C standard library. Since libraries are often developed independent of one another, they often use the same code values to represent different exceptions (e.g., one library may define the code 3 to be an error opening a file while another library may define the code 3 to be a divide-by-zero error) which is why the libraryID is needed. \n\nThat is, the equivalent of errno is the combination libraryID:code. To insure that each library's libraryID is unique, libraryIDs must be obtained from the function smr_registerLibrary.\n",

    "description" : "PyGSTi is a Python package for modeling and characterizing noise (errors) in small quantum information processors. In addition to being a basic framework for describing quantum circuits and noise models, it implements mainstream quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV) protocols such as Gate Set Tomography (GST), Randomized Benchmarking (RB), Robust Phase Estimation, and Idle Tomography. It also implements prototype protocols used for timeseries analysis and crosstalk detection, all of which have the goal of better understanding the noise found in existing as-built experimental devices. The central protocol of pyGSTi (from where it derives its name) is Gate Set Tomography. GST is a theory and protocol for simultaneously estimating the state preparation, gate operations, and measurement effects of a physical system of one or many quantum bits (qubits). These estimates are based entirely on the statistics of experimental measurements, and their interpretation and analysis can provide a detailed understanding of the types of errors/imperfections in the physical system. In this way, GST provides not only a means of certifying the 鈥済oodness鈥� of qubits but also a means of debugging (i.e.\nimproving) them. The other protocols follow this similar pattern in that they use statistical inference and analysis of experimental data to estimate one or more properties of the noise in a\ndevice.",

The objective of the system is to track mobile radioactive sources used in the well-logging service industry in support of oil and gas exploration. The individual software applications and libraries, and firmware executables work together and in conjunction with the electronic hardware components to provide situational awareness of the radioactive sources as they are transported from the home base of operations to a job site and back again. Information flows in near real time from the transport vehicle carrying the sources to the end user's central monitoring center using both cellular and satellite communications. A combination of active radio-frequency (RF) tags (attached to source shields) and radiation sensing is used to monitor the proximity of the radioactive sources to the transport vehicle. A Global Positioning System (GPS) is used to track the geographic location of the transport vehicle. Various sensors are used to detect and report tamper of the WL-MSTS components. An in-Cab Unit (iCU) is used to provide local status of the monitoring system to the driver of the transport vehicle. A browser based application allows authorized engineers to interact with the monitoring system to configure it and check status.

    "description" : "The scientific community performs a lot of redundant work when working with data. Researches tend to write their own code to perform basic functions for reading, visualizing, and analyzing the data. This strategy is unnecessarily time consuming, and potentially costly, for the individual researcher (as well as for programs). Open-source software disrupts that process and moves the development effort toward capabilities that can be used by the broader scientific community. The broader scientific community can then, in turn, contribute to and collaborate on efforts to improve the process for the individual researcher and program. Researchers will be able to do more science with fewer resources without the burden of developing code from the ground up. For any software to be adopted by a community, it needs to have a solid framework that will be easy to use and provide clear benefit worthy of the investment in participating. In support of this goal, our Atmospheric Data Community Toolkit will leverage the knowledge gained from the successful adoption of the Python Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) to build that framework. The framework will provide the environment to enable collaboration in the research community. This environment will allow the development of tools for funded programs, as well as provide researchers in the scientific community with code for advancing their work. Research programs will also be able to adopt code provided by the scientific community without having to develop it from scratch. The final goal of this proposed effort is to have a framework on GitHub that has the basic features that the atmospheric research community needs to begin working with and adopting, including, but not limited to, reading and visualization. We expect future effort will be needed for Argonne scientists to demonstrate their specific capabilities within this framework. This project will provide an avenue for other proposed research to be demonstrated, such as the Global Oceans/Argonne proposed Atmospheric Instrumentation Suite; edge computing National Science Foundation proposed effort; and the Computing, Environment, and Life Sciences Directorate's strategic effort on the Southern Great Plains climate observation site relating to water across the surface interface.

    "description" : "X-ray grating interferometry has been employed for a wide range of imaging applications by using the Talbot self-images of a grating. At synchrotron facilities, it has also been exploited to characterize the coherence and wavefront of the x-ray beam. The method is relatively straightforward, easy to implement, and provides accurate quantitative data. However, to exploit its full potential, it requires highly specialized, robust data analysis. If this works, we have set the framework for the development and dissemination of a robust open-source code called wavepy that is tailored to the data analysis for imaging and beam characterization using grating interferometry. Wavepy consists of a Python library for data analysis of x-ray grating interferometry. The library takes advantage of the python programming language capabilities and flexibility, and aims to be easy to collaborate, distribute, and integrate with other imaging packages. The main reason for using Python is twofold: to take advantage of a widely used language in the scientific community, and also to make extensive use of the existing Python libraries for numerical calculation and plotting, namely numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Installation is facilitated by using conda to solve dependencies. The development makes use of git for version control and collaborative development. The code is hosted in the GitHub repository https://github.com/APS-XSD-OPT-Group/wavepy. One of the reasons for using Python is to be able to integrate wavey with other projects, mainly DXchange to seamlessly load images of different formats, and TomoPy for tomography. The main code is a collection of functions that can be used in different ways, for instance, inside a development environment (DE) or by creating a graphical interface that uses wavepy underneath. ",

    "description" : "Metabolic engineering is a critical biotechnological approach in addressing global energy and environment challenges. Most engineering efforts, however, consist of laborious and inefficient trial-and-error of target pathways, due in part to the lack of methodologies that can comprehensively assess pathway properties in thermodynamics and kinetics.\nHere we introduce a computational toolbox, PathParser, which integrates multiple important functions for pathway analysis including thermodynamics analysis, kinetics-based protein cost optimization and robustness analysis. Specifically, PathParser enables optimization of the driving force of a pathway by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of least thermodynamically favorable reaction. In addition, based on reaction thermodynamics and enzyme kinetics, it can compute the minimal enzyme protein cost that supports metabolic flux, and evaluate pathway stability and flux in response to enzyme concentration perturbations. For more details please see the paper A generalized computational framework to streamline thermodynamics and kinetics analysis of metabolic pathways at the link below. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717619302587\nThis toolbox may have broad application in metabolic engineering and systems biology in microbial biomanufacturing systems.\n",

    "description" : "The system allows for multiple people to \"crowdsource\" feature generation and also enables the system to use these features to suggest alternative features to the user. The user interacts with a \"canvas\", where they position icons representing pieces of data. A unique feature is that the data can be heterogeneous -- some of the icons can represent images, while others could be text, audio, etc. After the user positions items on the screen to their satisfaction, they press a button to commit the X/Y coordinates of each icon to a central database, where these positions are added as a latent feature to each item. The user also has the option to request new, untouched data be added to the canvas, and the system positions each new item according the pattern it has learned from the original data. Another unique feature is that the user can ask the system to refine their initial rough work. The system uses information theoretic measures to determine which features in the database best explain how the user positioned the icons on the screen. It then attempts to *incrementally* optimize the positions on the screen to best explain those features it isolated. The user can then adjust the positions to correct the system, or the user can request additional refinement to further optimize the positions. In this way, by incorporating user feedback and crowdsourced features, the system reduces the time required for a user to develop a rich classification scheme for large amounts of data. ",

    "description" : "Flexible communication routines that enable high-performance computing (HPC) applications to operate with less synchronization are a great benefit to application algorithm creation and developer productivity. Further, communication operations that reduce synchronization in HPC applications while continuing to scale well are critical to application performance in the exascale era. We have implemented mechanisms that allow an application to scalably execute bcast/iAllReduce from any MPI rank without specifying the origin of the message in advance, demonstrating application development flexibility, highly scalable operation, and reduced application synchronization.",

    "description" : "Topology Reconfiguation is a simple algorithm to choose a network configuration with the least losses in a system with high penetration of renewable energy. It uses a linearized optimal power flow algorithm to identify the optimal setpoints of PV in a system, then performs an exhaustive search of switch configurations to find the loss minimizing solution, it repeats this process until convergence. At the end, the operator has a switch schedule for a 24 hour period that should minimize losses. VVC is a distributed algorithm in which PV units drive voltage at points within the network to 1 per unit through reactive power control. The VVC algorithm relies on extremum seeking control to provide the control. The software package is a simulation of VVC on a standard IEEE 34 bus three phase network.",

A recent version of Zeek introduced the configuration framework, where changes can be made while the system is running. However, the provided method is difficult to operationalize, as it requires a set of text files to be deployed and updated across all the Zeek systems.\n\neZeeKonfigurator provides an easy-to-use web interface to this. Users can view and modify options in a web application, and then those changes are deployed to the desired Zeek systems. Additionally, users benefit from additional features, such as:\n\n* Logging and auditing, to determine who made what change and when\n* Automated expiration of changes (e.g. an exception is added for 2 weeks, after which time it will be removed)\n* Validation of changes and verification that the change has been applied\n* Fine-grained role-based access",

    "description" : "The Moirai Land Data System (Moirai LDS) is designed to produce recent historical land data inputs for the AgLU module of GCAM data system , but the Moirai LDS outputs could also be used by other models/applications. The Moirai are the Greek Fates, and this software is named Moirai to represent the fundamental influence of land data inputs on model outcomes. The primary function of the Moirai LDS is to combine spatially explicit input data (e.g., raster images) with tabular input data (e.g., crop price table) to generate tabular output data for a suite of variables. Some of these outputs replace the data provide by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), and other data replace and augment the original GCAM GIS processing. The Moirai LDS output data are aggregated by Geographic Land Unit (GLU) within each country. The GLU coverage is an input to the Moirai LDS (as a thematic raster image and an associated CSV file that maps the thematic integers to names), and the GLU boundaries can be determined arbitrarily. Previous versions of GCAM (and Moirai LDS) used only bioclimatic Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) and corresponding data that were provided by GTAP, as the GLUs. As a result, some AEZ terminology still exists in the code, but this terminology now refers more generally to GLUs. The Moirai LDS now enables any set of boundaries to be used as GLUs (including AEZs), allowing for more flexible generation of land use region boundaries (defined as the intersection of GLUs with geopolitical regions). The current default set of GLUs is the same set of 235 global watersheds as used by the GCAM water module. The GCAM 5.1 geopolitical regions (32 or 14) are included and used as inputs to Moirai to generate a mapping file between the Moirai outputs, which are at the level of the intersection between the GLUs and the country boundaries, and the geopolitical regions. The diagnostics scripts use this geopolitical region mapping in some cases. Moirai can also recalibrate three of the outputs (crop production, harvested area, and land rent) to a specified year that is the center of a five-year averaging window. No recalibration retains the circa 2000, 7-year average of the source data. The cucrrency-year for land rent can also be specified, and the default is 2001 to match the GTAP data.",

    "description" : "The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has established a set of standardized high performance sequences of operation for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings through their \"Guideline 36\". In order to achieve the intended performance, these sequences must be translated and programmed accurately in the Building Automation System (BAS) controllers. Standardizing these sequences will allow for a more efficient product delivery mechanism where the sequences are programmed and tested centrally by each manufacturer, and then distributed to their dealers/engineering contractors. This approach would minimize the need for each installer to re-interpret and program the sequences, reduces risk of errors, and reduces the time required for commissioning in the field.\n\nTo achieve this goal, a performance validation method is needed to provide independent confirmation that each manufacturer has programmed the Guideline 36 sequences accurately. A standardized method of test would also avoid the need for manual interpretation (and the associated human variability) that is required with typical functional testing approaches by automating the inputs and the range of expected responses. This software \"guideline36_conformance_test\" has been developed to conduct standardized, repeatable and manufacturer independent tests to validate that a BAS controller has been programmed in conformance with Guideline 36. Manufacturers would provide the controller (or the control program) and the software would run a suite of tests by setting a set of inputs to the controller and verifying the output signals from the controller matches the expected output as set by Guideline 36.\n\n",

    "description" : "The Behavior, Energy, Autonomy, and Mobility (BEAM) model is an integrated, agent-based travel demand simulation framework. Individual agents express preferences through a utility-maximizing evolutionary algorithm that minimizes each individual's cost and time spent traveling via diverse modal options, including the competition for scarce supply resources such as parking spaces and charging infrastructure. BEAM simulates the essential elements that compose a dynamic transportation system. From the road network, parking and charging infrastructure, to the transit system and a synthetic population with plans and preferences, the virtual system is an amalgamation of multiple spatially resolved layers that together represent an integrated transportation system. BEAM is an extension to the MATSim (Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation) model, where agents employ reinforcement learning across successive simulated days to maximize their personal utility through plan mutation (exploration) and selecting between previously executed plans (exploitation). The BEAM model shifts some of the behavioral emphasis in MATSim from across-day planning to within-day planning, where agents dynamically respond to the state of the system during the mobility simulation. In BEAM, agents can plan across all major modes of travel including driving, walking, biking, transit, and demand-responsive ride hailing.",

    "description" : "Pairwise sequence alignment is one of the most compute-intense challenges for the analysis of genomics data and it can account for more than 90% of the runtime depending on the application. Despite the effort to reduce the computational cost introducing heuristics such as banded and x-drop alignment, the performance of state-of-the-art software is often unsatisfactory for long sequences. Recent advances in single-molecule sequencing technologies keep increasing the length of the sequences to align at the cost of higher error rates b ranging from 5% to 15% b, emphasizing the need for fast and accurate software.\n\nOur long-read alignment software, named Xavier, computes high-performance x-drop adaptive banded pairwise alignment exploiting instruction-level parallelism via Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) operations. Xavier uses a narrow bandwidth that appreciably improves performance reducing the search space for the optimal alignment. In our experiment, the adaptive mechanism enables Xavier to find the optimal alignment between related sequences even when the error rate is as high as 50%. Xavier achieves speed-up up to 5X over competitor software when enabling the x-drop termination and up to 415X when disabling it, with negligible accuracy loss.",

    "description" : "This software implements the first base caller for nanopore data that calls bases directly from raw data. The basecRAWller algorithm has two major advantages over current nanopore base calling software: (1) streaming base calling and (2) base calling from information rich raw signal. The ability to perform truly streaming base calling as signal is received from the sequencer can be very powerful as this is one of the major advantages of this technology as compared to other sequencing technologies. As such enabling as much streaming potential as possible will be incredibly important as this technology continues to become more widely applied in biosciences. All other base callers currently employ the Viterbi algorithm which requires the whole sequence to employ the complete base calling procedure and thus precludes a natural streaming base calling procedure. The other major advantage of the basecRAWller algorithm is the prediction of bases from raw signal which contains much richer information than the segmented chunks that current algorithms employ. This leads to the potential for much more accurate base calls which would make this technology much more valuable to all of the growing user base for this technology.",

    "description" : "Pairwise sequence alignment is one of the most computationally intensive kernels in genomic data analysis, accounting for more than 90% of the run time for key bioinformatics applications. This method is particularly expensive for third-generation sequences due to the high computational expense of analyzing these long read lengths (1Kb-1Mb). Given the quadratic overhead of exact pairwise algorithms such as Smith-Waterman, for long alignments, the community primarily relies on approximate algorithms that search only for high-quality alignments and stop early when one is not found. In this work, we present the first GPU optimization of the popular X-drop alignment algorithm, named LOGAN. Results show that our high-performance multi-GPU LOGAN implementation achieves up to 181.6 GCUPS and speed-ups up to 6.6x and 30.7x using 1 and 6 NVIDIA Tesla V100, respectively, over the state-of-the-art software running on two IBM Power9 processors using 168 threads, with equivalent accuracy. We also demonstrate a 2.3x LOGAN speed-up versus ksw2, a state-of-art vectorized algorithm for sequence alignment implemented in minimap2. To highlight the impact of our work on a real-world application, we couple the LOGAN aligner with a many-to-many long-read alignment software called BELLA, and demonstrate that our implementation improves the overall BELLA runtime by up to 10.6x. Finally, we adapt the Roofline model for our optimized kernel and demonstrate that our implementation is near-optimal on the NVIDIA Tesla V100s.",

    "description" : "There are numerous options for renewable energy systems development. Location, size, type of system, and a number of other criteria need to be considered. The objective of this program is to determine the optimal size (capacity, Kilowatt (kW)) of a renewable energy generator, based on minimizing life cycle cost (LCC). The reason for developing such a program is driven by three major issues. First, the need to evaluate a very large number (tens of thousands) of project opportunity sites. Next, the need for data transfer efficiency and computational efficiency in on-line and mobile applications. And lastly, to increase the accuracy of screening studies, which are the earliest indicators of project opportunities. Many existing programs require the user to enter the size (kW) of the renewable energy system in order to start calculations. \n \nHowever, there are many factors that affect what the size should be including: renewable energy resources, utility rates, initial and maintenance costs, and economic parameters. NREL scientists have developed an algorithm that addresses the previous three major issues. Lifecycle cost is calculated based on: the sum of initial cost, plus the present value of operations and maintenance costs, costs involved with purchasing power from the utility company, and revenue involved with the sale of excess electricity back to the utility.\n\nThe algorithm computes the derivative of an equation for LCC as a function of the size of the renewable energy generator (P), then sets the derivative equal to zero (dLCC/dP=0), and solves for the value of (P) that minimizes life cycle cost. Once the size (P) has been determined, other project details may be calculated. This algorithm develops a closed-form solution for the optimal size of a renewable energy generator. Having a closed-form solution avoids problems of scale and speed that can be encountered with optimization algorithms. Incentives that affect initial cost or provide a payment for energy production are also represented.\n\nBecause the algorithm was built in terms of analytics (calculus) and not numeric methods, it can be easily implemented in any platform such as spreadsheets or mobile computing applications. The program is very accurate as long as the simplifying assumptions in the derivation apply: constant load (during daylight hours for PV, all hours for wind); a single rate for all power purchased from the utility; and a single rate for all power sold back to the utility.  The program calculates energy saved on-site and energy sold back to the utility using a duration curve based on capacity factor.  Data for the calculation is available on-line at www.nrel.gov/gis.",

Locations of key points of interest in the app (such as the dog) are randomly generated when the game is restarted途 however, replay without a restart of the game allows users to try the same scenario again with a different search strategy.

    "description" : "Linux style development, like what we do for particle physics experiments at Fermilab, is becoming more difficult on the Mac. Apple is moving to its own style of development that is often incompatible. For example,\n\n* System Integrity Protection (SIP) prevents using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, breaking the mechanism used by our development environment system, ups.\n\n* Mac headers and system libraries are not always compatible with those on Linux, necessitating platform dependent code.\n\n* XCode is more focused on Swift, Objective-C, and Mac or iOS-style development. XCode does not understand CMake builds natively.\n\nThe differences that Mac and XCode introduce are difficult to manage and many experiments have stopped making Mac builds. Despite these problems, Mac laptops remain powerful machines and the MacOS environment is advantageous in many other areas. Therefore, mitigating the problems with Linux style development is motivated.\n\nThis package contains a configuration for docker containers along with instructions for integrating with the Mac that make for an effective and efficient development platform for Linux style development of physics code. Instructions for using CLion for C++ development in this environment are given in the documentation for running CLion within the linux container or from the Mac host.\n\nNote that the containers and techniques here may also work on Windows.

    "description" : "Persistent model serves as the baseline in the intra-hour forecasting of solar radiation due to the extensive computing efforts from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and the lack of surface observations in cloud as well as other atmospheric properties. The smart persistent model actively updates the extraterrestrial solar radiation with time and is an important improvement from the persistent model while the cloud conditions are assumed unchanged by giving constant clear-sky indexes. We developed a Physics-based Smart Persistent model for Intra-hour solar forecasting (PSPI) to further improve the accuracy of the smart persistent model. We used a cloud retrieval technique developed by Xie and Liu (2013) to estimate cloudy fraction and cloud albedo using surface-based observations of solar radiation. The solar radiation in future time steps is accurately given by actively computing individual cloud albedo related to the future solar position. Our evaluation studies indicated that the PSPI model significantly increased the accuracy in the short-term forecast of solar radiation, especially in thin cloud conditions or those covered by broken clouds.",

    "description" : "A clear way to increase current capabilities for seismic nuclear explosion monitoring is to supplement the global International Monitoring System (IMS) network with openly available stations. The quality of openly available data is typically much lower than that of the IMS, given the wide variety of experimental goals and deployment conditions. Incorporating additional stations without properly identifying and mitigating data quality problems can actually degrade overall monitoring capabilities. Towards that objective, Pycheron, a python-based library for seismic data quality control (QC) was developed. Pycheron began as a translation of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Modular Utility for STAtistical kNowledge Gathering (MUSTANG) package (written in R) into Python, but has grown into a stand-alone package that includes significant additional functionality. Pycheron is intended to be implemented at the beginning of the data processing pipeline. The objectives of the library are to: automatically assess data quality and instrumentation health; maintain the highest quality of data possible; identify specific and key problems; alert downstream processing algorithms to any degradation in quality; improve our ability to process orders of magnitudes more data; and, serve as a basic service that all data processing within our program builds upon. Pycheron calculates metrics characterizing quality over time as well as creating QC masks to identify each interval with a QC problem.

    "description" : "Deep learning has been applied with great success to the segmentation of 3D X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Establishing the credibility of these segmentations requires uncertainty quantification (UQ) to identify problem areas. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which use variational inference to learn the posterior distribution of the neural network weights, have been proposed to incorporate UQ into deep learning models.  This software is an implementation of a novel 3D Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) that provides accurate binary segmentations and uncertainty maps for 3D volumes. In particular, the uncertainty maps generated by this BCNN capture continuity and visual gradients, making them interpretable as confidence intervals for segmentation usable in numerical simulations.

    "description" : "Identification of cell state based on objective metrics is a fundamental problem in developmental biology. With the advent of fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), transcriptomics, and (more recently) single-cell RNA sequencing, it has become possible to profile mRNA abundance of all genes in individual cells or cell types. This transcriptomic information for cell types is often characteristic, and can be used to classify cell types for cells with unknown identity. Previously, an algorithm was developed using a Bayesian method to derive specificity scores for all genes across all known cell types, and then to use these scores to assign the most likely cell type for a new transcriptomic profile. ICITools implements this Index of Cell Identity algorithm as an R package, making the method more easily distributed. In addition, this package implements slight improvements on the previous implementation by adding parallelization, small enhancements in speed, and the ability to customize some aspects of the specificity score computation method. The package does not alter the underlying algorithm, nor the overall functionality of the original methods.",

    "description" : "Reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn optimal strategies for control problems with complex, stochastic dynamics. \n\nStandard RL formulations assume that transition dynamics are the same across episodes. \n\nHowever, this is not the case for many real-world environments, e.g. a disease process in which each patient is unique. \n\nTransfer learning in RL aims to solve this problem; however, existing methods allow for multiple trials on a test episode.\n\nWe consider the \"single episode transfer\" setting in which a policy is evaluated on one and only one test episode; thus, any adaptation must occur during that episode. \n\nSingle episode policy transfer (SEPT) is a framework for finding optimal control policies in this setting. \n\nIn SEPT, a \"probe policy\" initially probes the environment to gain information about how that episode is unique. \n\nThen, the information gained from the probe becomes an additional input to the \"universal policy\" that controls the remainder of the episode. \n\nSEPT is a general algorithm and can be used with any existing RL algorithm, including in batch learning mode.\n",

    "description" : "GEOPHIRES v2.0 is a geothermal techno-economic simulation tool upgraded from GEOPHIRES v1.2.  The name stands for \"GEOthermal energy for Production of Heat and electricity (鈥淚R鈥�) Economically Simulated\". GEOPHIRES combines reservoir, wellbore, and surface plant technical models with cost correlations and levelized cost models to estimate the capital and operation and maintenance costs, instantaneous and lifetime energy production, and overall levelized cost of energy of a geothermal plant. In addition to electricity generation, direct-use heat applications and combined heat and power or cogeneration can be modeled. Various upgrades have been implemented to develop GEOPHIRES v2.0, including: updating the built-in cost correlations, coupling to the external reservoir simulator TOUGH2, enhancing the built-in wellbore simulator, converting the programming language to Python, and making the code open-source. Users are encouraged to build upon the tool, e.g. by implementing their own correlations or coupling to other simulators. ",

The reV model currently supports photovoltaic (PV), concentrating solar power (CSP), and land-based wind turbine technologies. Modules in the reV framework function at different spatial and temporal resolutions, allowing for the assessment of resource potential, technical potential, and supply curves at varying levels of detail. The platform runs on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory鈥檚 (NREL鈥檚) high-performance computing system, providing scalable and efficient performance from a single location up to a continent, for a single year or decades of time-series resource data. Coupled with NREL鈥檚 System Advisor Model (SAM), reV supports resource assessments from 5-minute to hourly temporal resolutions and supports the analysis of long-term (i.e., year-on-year) variability of renewable generation (e.g., interannual variability and exceedance probabilities).

MIMOSAS provides an end-to-end data processing workflow, from data ingestion and pre-processing to model training and test set classification. The pipeline is specified via an input deck, making workflow customization effortless, and the framework is modular allowing for the easy addition of new learning algorithms. In the current build, the user selects from decision tree, random forest, and feed-forward neural network classifiers to train customizable models with built-in cross validation methods for hyperparameter optimization. Trained model outputs are stored with the associated metadata for rapid deployment. These can be applied in supervised classification to assess previously unseen data or for further training as new observations are added to the existing data set. MIMOSAS provides the capability to fuse a wide range of data sources (e.g., radiation, environmental, acoustic, seismic, imagery, etc.) to make, confirm, and correlate machine learning predictions for nuclear security applications.",

It is designed primarily for testing the outputs if a single function or simulation run by storing the expected results file such that comparisons to the stored output can be made with unit tests after the function or software has been edited.\n\nThis module is designed to be able to unit test arrays, strings, as well as nested and deeply nested objects (including arrays with tuples inside, arrays with strings inside, etc.). The module is compatable with nested objects, and thus has a dependency on the nestedObjectsFunctions module within. The module takes *calculated* results and then compares them to *expected* results. If no expected results are available (or they do not match the calculated results) the module then offers to store the calculated results as expected results for next time.",

These data have different structures and tools and are, therefore, used independently. The integration of data sources is often needed and is performed manually and on an as-needed basis. The integration of the data would enable creating a data warehouse for a single nuclear power plant (NPP) or multiple plants. \n\nA data model contains objects that make up a given domain along with their attributes and relationships and could be used as a standard for exchange between applications for simple integration and data aggregation. After a survey of existing models, it was determined that a new model was required to meet the scope of this problem. DIAMOND has been developed in the form of an ontology to meet these needs. An ontology is simply a data model that also acts as a taxonomy for the domain, organizing the objects in a hierarchy with the most general objects at the top.",

    "description" : "As power becomes an important resource to provision for modern HPC systems it becomes crucial to\nobtain deeper insights into application's power and thermal characteristics and to correlate application\ncontext with important system-level measurements. Existing profiling tools to monitor power and thermal\nmeasurements either operate at a granularity that is not fine enough to correlate with application-level\nevents that describe application context or are not equipped to sample application-level events\ntransparently. We introduce LibPowerMon, a lightweight, vendor-neutral user-level profiling framework to\nsimultaneously sample user-specified application events and system-level metrics at up to 1 kHz\nsampling intervals. At the application level, LibPowerMon provides a source-level phase markup interface\nto capture application context. At runtime level, LibPowerMon records MPI and OpenMP events and can\nbe extended to include other runtimes. At the system level, LibPowerMon samples power, thermal and\nrelevant metrics, and provides an extensible interface to system's control capabilities. In this release,\nLibPowerMon supports monitoring and control functionalities on the Intel, IBM Power9 and Nvidia Volta architectures.\n",

Opportunities are identified for users to make their own choices for analysis of the data.\n The code is written to be a stand-alone operation on data collected from a pulse neutron source that have been previously normalized to the wavelength dependence of the incident beam spectrum, background subtracted, etc. The constant Qz binning (this code) is the last step to perform in the analysis (reduction) workflow. This step yields the the reflectivities for the four neutron spin cross-sections.\n A future intention is to create a version of this code that will be one module of many in the data analysis workflow.\n",

PRUNERS is a research and development project that aims at innovating scalable techniques to aid applications to obtain the reproducibility.

    "description" : "STRUMPACK - STRUctured Matrix PACKage - is a software library providing linear algebra routines for sparse matrices and for dense rank-structured matrices, i.e., matrices that exhibit some kind of low-rank property. In particular, STRUMPACK uses the Hierarchically Semi-Separable matrix format (HSS). Such matrices appear in many applications, e.g., Finite Element Methods, Boundary Element Methods ... In sparse matrix factorization, the fill-in in the triangular factors often has a low-rank structure. Hence, the sparse linear solve in STRUMPACK exploits the HSS matrix format to compress the fill-in. Exploiting this structure using a compression algorithm allows for fast solution of linear systems and/or fast computation of matrix-vector products, which are two of the main building blocks of matrix computations. STRUMPACK has two main components: a distributed-memory dense matrix computations package (for dense matrices that have the HSS structure) and a distributed memory fully algebraic sparse general solver and preconditioner. The preconditioner is mostly aimed at large sparse linear systems which result from the discretization of a partial differential equation, but is not limited to any particular type of problem. STRUMPACK also provides preconditioned GMRES and BiCGStab iterative solvers.",

This feedback is used to optimize kinetics mechanisms based on experimental observables. Optimization\ncan be performed either by hand or built-in optimization routines. There is currently support for high-temperature\nchemical kinetics experiments that can be simulated using a 0d reactor or using a custom reactor built for\nmeasurements taken behind incident shock waves. Such experiments include shock tubes, idealized rapid compression\nmachines, etc. Additional tools for exploring chemical kinetics mechanisms are provided such as the simulation\nexplorer, which can graph an extensive list of combustion relevant variables. The guiding principle of Frhodo is to\nelevate researcher capabilities by minimizing repetitive tasks.\n",

    "description" : "With function preserving projection (FPP), we aim to address high-dimensional data exploration\nchallenges common in many scientific applications. Instead of preserving the global or local geometric\nstructure of a dataset like traditional dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., principal component\nanalysis, t-stochastic neighborhood embedding), the proposed approach finds a linear projection that\nreveal interpretable (yet potentially nonlinear) pattern of the properties of interests defined on a highdimensional\ndomain (e.g., simulation yield defined on the input parameter space).\nThe key insight driving FPP is the fact that while non-linear embeddings are difficult to interpret, humans\nare highly skilled in understanding complex visual patterns. FPP lets users select the complexity of a\npattern they consider interpretable, allows to find a joint projection that explains multiple functions, and\nprovides a confidence statistic (akin to a p-value) indicating how salient the resulting pattern is. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on several synthetic and scientific datasets for both\ncontinuous (regression) and discrete (classification) problems of interests and illustrate the scalability of\nFPP by finding an optimal projection for close to 40 gigabytes in around 10 minutes.\n",

It consists of three main components:  an ns-3 packet reporting module; a sampler running simulations with all possible parameter sets for the input parameter variables by using a parallel executor at each generation; and a hybrid optimization algorithm for tuning configurable parameters of hybrid designs and application parameter variables. The proposed hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm combines an evolutionary algorithm with a gradient descent function to quickly achieve an approximate globally optimum solution.\n\nThis software is designed to be used in a multi-core processing Linux environment and run over a long duration of time. The execution time varies depending mainly upon the nature of the ns-3 configuration being simulated. This software includes a custom ns-3 QoS measurement application which must be included with the ns-3 source code during installation of the software.",

The CheKiPEUQ software provides tools for finding physically realistic parameter estimates.and CheKiPEUQ provide tools for making graphs of the parameter positions within parameter space as well as plots of the final simulation results.\n\nThe primary purpose of the CheKiPEUQ software is to enable more physically realistic parameter estimation from comparing simulations to experiments. Specifically, when prior knowledge is available about the region of parameter space which is physically realistic and when the level of uncertainty from experiment can be estimated. The software is intentionally general and can be used for almost any type of simulation. The software is made in a user friendly manner so that users can simply enter the required data and then run the program, following guidelines provided by the authors along with some trial and error. Examples are provided. Users do not need to understand the methodology that will be namedi in the following sentences. While CheKiPEUQ can be used for conventional parameter estimation and other uses, the primary uses for CheKiPEUQ are: 1) Bayesian Parameter Estimation, 2) Bayesian Model Discrimination, 3) Bayesian Design of Experiments. For more information see the project website, documentation, examples, and related publications.",

    "description" : "ZFP is a floating-point compression format gaining traction in high-performance computing applications. A\nsoftware implementation has demonstrated the ability to reduce data movement across communication\nchannels and to reduce the footprint of floating-point arrays in memory. Nevertheless, any benefit in\nperformance is limited to the spare compute cycles available before reaching bandwidth limitations. A\nhardware implementation of ZFP has the potential to substantially improve HPC application performance.\nHardware compression speedup over software alone on a single CPU core ranges from 15x for 1-D\narrays to over 200x for 3-D arrays.\nThe implementation of ZFP is sourced in SystemC to facilitate its evaluation in various architectures. The\nencode pipeline consists of several modules. Uncompressed blocks of floating-point numbers in IEEE\nformat flow into the pipeline in a stream and a compressed bitstream flows out from the pipeline. The\ndecode pipeline is the inverse of the encode pipeline. A modular design enables formats other than IEEE\n(such as posits) to be considered with minor adaptations. Best performance will be realized from the\nhardware ZFP unit when batches of blocks are processed at a time. The implementation supports 1-D, 2-\nD and 3-D blocks of floating-point numbers.\nThe hardware implementation of ZFP has been validated with the software implementation of ZFP. C++\ntemplate parameters are used to specify the bit width of floating-point numbers and the array dimension\nof the encoder. A test bench program has been created with several test cases, some with continuous\ndata that is ideal for ZFP, and others with extreme cases containing numbers near or at the maximum or\nminimum values supported by the number format.",

    "description" : "Logic in Memory Emulator (LiME) is a hardware/software tool specially designed for memory system evaluation and experiment. Emerging memories display a wide range of bandwidths, latencies, and capacities, making it challenging for the computer architect to navigate the design space of potential memory configurations, and for the application developer to assess performance implications of using such memories. With the LiME framework, architectural ideas can be prototyped in great detail yet with sufficient performance to support realistic evaluation on long running applications. LiME consists of two fundamental components: 1) the hardware and OS infrastructure for the emulator, and 2) a suite of benchmark applications to assist in characterizing the performance of current and future computer architectures. Some of the applications have been collected from other open source projects.\nUses:\nLogging, replay and analysis of an application's memory behavior Evaluate impact of emerging memory technology on application performance. Emulate complex memory interactions in whole applications orders of magnitude faster than software\nsimulation. Emulate acceleration hardware co-located with the memory subsystem.\nFeatures:\nCapture and log external memory accesses to a separate off-chip memory device without affecting application execution.\nMemory traces include the address, length, timestamp, and optionally the data for each transaction. Captured trace data can be saved to an SD card for off-line analysis.\nConfigure a wide range of memory latencies in sub-nanosecond increments that encompass highbandwidth and storage class memories.\nSpecify regions of interest (ROI) in applications to reduce the amount of trace data captured for analysis. Currently supports execution on Xilinx Zynq SoC which integrates an ARM processor with FPGA logic on a single device.\nApplications can be run under Linux or in bare metal mode on the ARM cores.",

    "description" : "greg(g)d - Global runtime for eBPF-enabled gathering (w/ gumption) daemon\n\nRecently the linux kernel has added support for low-level kernel monitoring and\nprofiling through a in-kernel virtual machine. The tooling around these new\nfeatures (the extended Berkley Packet Filter or eBPF for short) is not mature\nand is difficult to use. Benefits from eBPF are especially hard to realize\nwhile trying to do large scale deployments and integrate with existing metric\nanalysis stacks. A tool was needed to enable loading and collecting data from\neBPF programs on large scale HPC systems.\n\nGiven the problems above it was obvious we needed some wrapper program to\ncompile, load, and collect data from eBPF programs running in the kernel. This\ntool needed to be lightweight without a heavy set of dependencies, relatively\nstable between different kernel versions, and integrate nicely with existing\nwidely used metric collection tools.\n\nWe wrote a program that wraps the eBPF tooling and sends data to our metric\ngathering tool. eBPF programs are either compiled using the host compiler\nstack, or loaded in the kernel directly from an object file. These programs are\nthen attached to the system calls that we want to profile. Whenever these\nsystem calls are run, the eBPF program collects information of interest and\nwrites that to memory. Our wrapper program polls these memory locations, reads\nand formats the data, then sends the information to a local unix socket. Our\nother monitoring tools are configured to read from that socket and send it to\nthe rest of our metric monitoring stack for analysis.",

    "description" : "TOUGH is a widely used general purpose numerical simulator designed for fluid and heat flows of multiphase, multicomponent fluid mixtures in porous and fractured media, which has been applied to many real-world problems such as underground geological storage, geothermal reservoir engineering or nuclear waste disposal, to name a few.\n\n`toughio` is a lightweight, object-oriented and vectorized Python library that aims to provide user-friendly routines to facilitate pre- and post-processing of a TOUGH simulation. Although its primary target is the latest version TOUGH3, `toughio` can also be used to read/write TOUGH2 input/output files. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, only PyTOUGH offers an exhaustive number of features to carry out a complete TOUGH simulation using a scripting language. `toughio` and PyTOUGH share the same objectives, yet with different approaches and philosophies. On the one hand, a PyTOUGH mesh is represented as a MULGRAPH geometry where elements can be unstructured horizontally but only layered vertically. It also checks that the model parameters are valid to ensure that a TOUGH simulation runs smoothly. On the other hand, although it provides basic meshing features, `toughio` mostly relies on common third-party softwares (e.g. Abaqus, FLAC3D, Gmsh, LaGriT) to generate the mesh by importing and converting it to a TOUGH mesh, which also conveniently facilitates the coupling of TOUGH with any other simulator that also supports the same mesh formats. Besides, `toughio` is designed to be just a TOUGH input and output file reader/writer. It assumes that the user knows what he is doing and does not verify the validity of the model parameters (`toughio` does verify the functional arguments).",

    "description" : "We present QFAST, a quantum synthesis tool designed to produce short circuits and to scale well in practice. Our contributions are: 1) a novel representation of circuits able to encode placement and topology; 2) a hierarchical approach with an iterative refinement formulation that combines \"coarse-grained\" fast optimization during circuit structure search with a good, but slower, optimization stage only in the final circuit instantiation stage. When compared against state-of-the-art techniques, although not optimal, QFAST can generate much shorter circuits for \"time dependent evolution\" algorithms used by domain scientists. We also show the composability and tunability of our formulation in terms of circuit depth and running time. For example, we show how to generate shorter circuits by plugging in the best available third party synthesis algorithm at a given hierarchy level. Composability enables portability across chip architectures, which is missing from the available approaches.",

Note that (1) the prognostic CO2\nconfiguration of E3SM has not been scientifically validated, and (2) the regridding of emission\nfiles as currently implemented is not mass-conserving and is intended as a temporary workaround.\nWe do not advise using E3SMv1.1 for fully-coupled carbon cycle simulations where mass conservation\nis critical, but it is suitable for enabling use of the 3D CO2 tracer for diagnostic and testing purposes.\n\nSeveral bugs found after v1.0 have been fixed in this tag and changes made to default settings, including:\n    EAM: adding limiters to avoid bad extrapolation in RRTMG, fixing an error in the calculation of NIR\n    reflectance that affects cloud fields derived from MODIS simulator.\n    ELM: fixing surface water and lakes, increasing the land field name size, fixing a memory leak in\n    ELM CNStateType, fixing a snow compaction bug that was resulting in sporadic unphysical snow depths,\n    adding a water budget in the land model (and fixing a water conservation error)\n    MPAS-O: preventing thermo energy conservation errors by lowering the permitted surface flux error\n    in the mushy layer picard iteration to 0.9*ferrmax, fixing a small bug in marine BGC,\n    MPAS-SeaIce: Turning off mpas-seaice history files by default\n    MOSART: Replacing the low-res (half-degree) MOSART file\n\nIn addition, the budget output has been turned on by default for any fully coupled case, and CIME was\nmodified to remove a bad term from E3SM water budgets. The CCSM_CO2_PPMV is now set correctly in BGC cases. A bugfix for the IEFLX output is included and the timestep for the EC60to30 mesh has been\nupdated. Finally, a number of minor bugfixes and technical improvements have been introduced in the\nEAM, ELM and MPAS-Ocean models.\n\nMachine updates for cascade, edison, eos, cori are included.",

    "description" : "\"Kinetic simulations of microstructural evolution\" (KSOME) is an object Kinetic Monte Carlo (OMKC) simulation code.  It is developed to simulate microstructural evolution in materials during irradiation.  KSOME is developed from ground up with priority given to the flexibility, ease of upgradability, and computation efficiency, in that order. With previously developed simulation codes, various processes (more precisely, the diffusion-reaction processes) that can occur in a system were hardwired into the code. Hence, to perform higher fidelity simulations, a significant coding effort was required every time to incorporate either a more accurate description of existing processes or new processes. With KSOME, the necessity for frequent code upgrades whenever there is a need to perform higher fidelity simulations is either eliminated or reduced significantly.  In KSOME, the categories of various diffusion-reaction processes and the data-management system are hardwired, while the execution of the diffusion-reaction processes specific to a system is specified via input files. In the present version of KSOME, the analytical expression required to calculate defect interaction radii are inputted via a text file. However, the ability to parse mathematical expressions from a text file can be extended to input the analytical expression to calculate other defect properties; including the expressions to calculate the change in the migration barriers of mobile defects due to long-range interaction with extended defects ",

Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Argonne has developed a full life-cycle model called GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies).

Since then, Argonne has continued to update and expand the model. GREET is developed as a multidimensional spreadsheet model in Microsoft Excel. It provides a comprehensive, life-cycle-based approach to compare the energy use and emissions of conventional and advanced vehicle technologies. It includes two sub-models named Fuel-Cycle Model (GREET 1, contains data on fuel cycles and vehicle operations) and Vehicle-Cycle Model (GREET 2, evaluates the energy and emission effects associated with vehicle material recovery and production, vehicle component fabrication, vehicle assembly, and vehicle disposal/recycling).

This software bridges the gap between data acquisition and visualization by providing tools to adjust for misalignment in the imaging process and tools for running reconstructions[2], all with the use of a GUI or command line. XRFtomo accepts .h5 files processed through MAPS[3] and it outputs reconstructed cross-sections, projections, sinograms, metadata, and a configuration file with last-used parameters for rapid processing the next time the program is launched. These images serve as inputs for other 3D visualization software for generating volumetric renderings and animations. ",

    "description" : "The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed the Road Grade Inference Tool, \"GradeIT\". This tool is a modular Python package the leverages the United States Geological Survey鈥檚 (USGS) 1/3 arc-second Digital Elevation Model (DEM), an open and free public dataset. Roadway gradient (slope) has a strong influence on vehicle energy consumption behavior and longitudinal dynamics. Therefore, any tools, models, or analyses that consider vehicle energy consumption or driving profiles is incomplete without accurate elevation and grade information. Despite the acute need for this data, it is rarely collected alongside GPS (latitude and longitude) data, and tools to post-process GPS data to append elevation and grade are difficult to come by. GradeIT satisfies this significant need in the research community. \n\nUtilization of the USGS DEM makes the underlying data available to any potential user and ensures continuous data anywhere in the continental United States. The USGS DEM is a great resource; however, in order to be useful for automotive and traffic engineering applications, significant interpolation and filtering is required to achieve an accurate representation of gradient on the roadway. GradeIT employs a two-dimensional interpolation to approximate elevation at a point on the road from the nearest nodes in the DEM. Then, GradeIT applies multiple filtering techniques to smooth the elevation profile to a realistic road topology. Finally, road grade is derived from the elevation profile and returned as the primary output.",

    "description" : "Compression-based distance (CBD) is a simple, rapid, and accurate method to efficiently assess differences in microbiota samples. CBD characterizes the similarities between microbial communities via the amount of repetition or overlap in order to determine microbial community distance. CBD relies on the fact that more repetitive data is the more it can be compressed. By combining 16S rRNA hypervariable tag data from different samples and assessing the relative amounts of compression, there is a proxy for the similarities between the communities. The amount of compression is converted to a distance by taking compression gained by combining the datasets over the total compressed size of the individual datasets. The distance has a value with a minimum of 0 meaning the communities are the same and a maximum of 1 meaning the communities are completely different.",

It is capable of building polymer chains with five different chemistries: vinyl/olefin, polyamide, polycarbonate, polyester, and polyimides.

    "description" : "This python toolkit has been developed to automate 3D segmentation of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) data using convolutional neural networks - an AI methodology. Specifically, it binarizes CT scans with a focus on accurate surfaced Determination, with applications including but not limited to metrology of metallic components, surface characterization of manufactured components and porosity measurements in opaque media. In addition, subroutines for training with\nnew manually annotated data, including data augmentation methods have been provided. The toolkit operates on any arbitrarily sized CT volumes and is tested on up to sizes 3000^3 on a desktop workstation. In principle, this algorithm is scalable to larger CT volumes on GPU clusters. Briefly, the 3D segmentation algorithm is powered by a 2D convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and systematically slices, patches 3D data and feeds into the CNN. At the output end, the data is stitched back into a 3D segmented volume which is exactly aligned with the input volume. The 2D architecture offers\nlower GPU memory requirement while maintaining accuracy, which has been characterized on high-resolution CT scans\nof fuel injector nozzles. The package is built on top of TensorFlow / Keras and exploits CUDA-based GPU computing for\nthe CNN path and parallelization over CPU for the 2D-3D image processing operations.\n(",

Applications can run in paralle so long as the simulation domain can be partitoned spatially so that multiple events can be invoked simultaneously.    SPPARKS is used to model various kinds of mesoscale materials science scenarios such as grain growth, surface deposition and growth, and reaction kinetics. It can also be used to develop new Monte Carlo models that hook to the existing solver and paralle infrastructure provided by the code.",

Currently, engineering teams operate in siloed tools and disparate teams where connections across design, procurement, and construction systems are translated manually or over brittle point-to-point integrations. The manual nature of data exchange increases the risk of silent errors in the reactor design, with each silent error cascading across the design. These cascading errors lead to uncontrollable risk during construction, resulting in significant delays and cost overruns.

    "description" : "TEAL is a financial performance calculator plugin for the RAVEN code, framework, resolving around the computation of Net Present Value and associated financial metrics. TEAL can make use of inflation rates, taxation, escalation factors, capital expenditure economy of scale scaling factors. The unique feature of TEAL is the capability to be linked with RAVEN external models and build corresponding cash flows using the variables computed by those external models. In addition to be able to use the capability to generate cash flows derived from complex physical models generated by RAVEN, another distinctive feature of TEAL is the capability to provide financial risk/probabilistic metrics that can empower RAVEN to perform optimization/analysis driven by financial risk augmentations. Optimization, robust optimization, parametric studies, large parallel simulations, sensitivity analysis, data mining, etc. are just some of the capabilities that can be leveraged.",

    "description" : "Field Landscape Decision Support (FieLDS) is a decision support tool that assists agricultural producers and farm managers in selecting parts of the field that can be converted to bioenergy plants, like perennial grasses, from the conventional use, like corn or soybean growth. That conversion of parts of the field is done based on the specific landscape properties and the agricultural producer鈥檚 priorities. The decision support tool generates a map of the field layout and spatially marks where to place each plant based on the spatial input from the user. Also, the user selects which priorities (sustainability indicators) are most relevant to them in their decision-making. By allowing the user to set the weights among the priorities, the tool empowers the user to generate field designs specific to their needs instead of imposing the developer鈥檚 set of priorities, and increases the transparency of the decision process.

When naturally-occurring, high-energy (gigaelectronvolt) cosmic rays impact the earth鈥檚 atmosphere, they create an avalanche of secondary particles which will register as a large, positive spike on any spectroscopic detector they hit. Cosmic ray spikes are therefore an unavoidable spectroscopic contaminant which can interfere with subsequent analysis. A variety of cosmic ray despiking algorithms already exist and can potentially be applied to hyperspectral data matrices, most notably the upper-bound spectrum data matrices (UBS-DM) algorithm by Dongmao Zhang and Dor Ben-Amotz which served as the basis for the hyper-UBS algorithm. However, the existing algorithms either cannot be applied to hyperspectral data, require information that is not always available, introduce undesired spectral bias, or have otherwise limited effectiveness for some experimentally relevant conditions. Hyper-UBS is more effective at removing a wider variety of cosmic ray spikes from hyperspectral data without introducing undesired spectral bias.  In addition to the core algorithm the Sandia hyper-UBS software package includes additional source code useful in evaluating the effectiveness of the hyper-UBS algorithm. The accompanying source code includes code to generate simulated hyperspectral data contaminated by cosmic ray spikes, several existing despiking algorithms, and code to evaluate the performance of the despiking algorithms on simulated data.",

    "description" : "As parallel computing trends towards the exascale, scientific data produced by high-fidelity simulations are growing increasingly massive. For instance, a simulation on a three-dimensional spatial grid with 512 points per dimension that tracks 64 variables per grid point for 128 time steps yields 8 TB of data. By viewing the data as a dense five-way tensor, we can compute a Tucker decomposition to find inherent low-dimensional multilinear structure, achieving compression ratios of up to 10000 on real-world data sets with negligible loss in accuracy. So that we can operate on such massive data, we present the first-ever distributed-memory parallel implementation for the Tucker decomposition, whose key computations correspond to parallel linear algebra operations, albeit with nonstandard data layouts. Our approach specifies a data distribution for tensors that avoids any tensor data redistribution, either locally or in parallel. This software provides a method for compressing large-scale multiway data.",

This requires accurate assignment of genes to genomes, yet existing binning methods often fail to predict a reasonable number of genomes and report many bins of low quality and completeness. Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotypes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms. DAS Tools applied to a constructed community generated more accurate bins than any automated method. Further, when applied to samples of different complexity, including soil, natural oil seeps, and the human gut, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes than any single binning method alone. Included were three genomes from a novel lineage . The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.",

The material model is designed to work with existing finite element packages by providing updated information on material properties that are nonlinear and dependent on loading history. The two major nonlinear phenomena this model captures are domain-switching and phase transformation. The software itself does not contain potentially sensitive material information and instead provides a framework for different physical phenomena observed within ferroelectric materials. The model is calibrated to a specific ferroelectric material through input parameters provided by the user.",

All variants of each kernel perform essentially the same mathematical operations and the loop body code for each kernel is identical across all variants. There are a few kernels, such as those that contain reduction  operations, that require CUDA-specific coding for their CUDA variants. ActuaJ computer instructions executed and how they run in parallel differs depending on the parallel programming model backend used and which optimizations are  perfonned by the compiler used to build the Perfonnance Suite executable.  The Suite will be used primarily by RAJA developers to perform regular  assessments of RAJA performance across a range of hardware platforms and  compilers as RAJA features are being developed. It will also be used by LLNL hardware and software vendor panners for new defining requirements for future computing platform procurements and acceptance testing. In particular, the RAJA Performance Suite will be used for compiler acceptance testing of the upcoming CORAUSierra machine {initial LLNL delivery expected in late-2017/early 2018) and the CORAL-2 procurement.

    "description" : "DEBS advances the resistive MHD equations via a combination of the explicit leapfrop method and the semi-implicit method.  In this way the time step is limited by the CFL condition v*kmax*dt < 1, where v is the local flow velocity, NOT the wave propagation (sound plus Alfven) velocity.  The code is thus able to take timesteps that are much larger than allowed by purely explicit codes. For the spatial discretization, DEBS uses a finite difference approximation for the radial variation and a Fourier representation for the variation of the fields in the poloidal and axial directions, i.e it assumes a doubly-periodic geometry. It advances the vector potential in lieu of the magnetic field and uses the Weyl gauge which assumes the electrostatic potential is zero",

GreenNMFk allows an efficient and high performance de-mixing and feature extraction of a multitude of nonnegative signals that change their shape propagating through the medium. The signals are mixed and recorded by a network of uncorrelated sensors. The code couples Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and inverse-analysis Green's functions method. GreenNMF synergistically performs decomposition of the recorded mixtures, finds the number of the unknown sources and uses the Green's function of the governing partial differential equation to identify   the unknown sources and their charecteristics. GreenNMF can be applied directly to any problem controlled by a known partial-differential parabolic equation where mixtures of an unknown number of sources are measured at multiple locations. Full GreenNMFk method is a subject LANL U.S. Patent application S133364.000 August, 2017.

    "description" : "MathWorks' MATLAB is widely used in academia and industry for prototyping, data analysis, data processing, etc. Many users compile their programs using the MATLAB Compiler to run on workstations/computing clusters via the free MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). The MCR facilitates the execution of code calling Application Programming Interfaces (API) functions from both base MATLAB and MATLAB toolboxes. In a Linux environment, a sizable number of third-party runtime dependencies (i.e. shared libraries) are necessary. Unfortunately, to the MTLAB community's knowledge, these dependencies are not documented, leaving system administrators and/or end-users to find/install the necessary libraries either as runtime errors resulting from them missing or by inspecting the header information of Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) libraries of the MCR to determine which ones are missing from the system. To address various shortcomings, Docker Images based on Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS) 7, a derivative of Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, containing recent (2015-2017) MCR releases and their dependencies were created. These images, along with a provided sample Docker Compose YAML Script, can be used to create a simulated computing cluster where MATLAB Compiler created binaries can be executed using a sample Slurm Workload Manager script.",

    "description" : "Boiler tubes in steam power plants experience exfoliation of oxide grown on the inner side of the tubes. In extreme cases, the exfoliation cause significant tube blockages that lead to forced power plant outages. It is thus desired to predict through modeling the propensity of exfoliation events in order to inform power plant operators of possible tube blockages. SpallMap solves for the stress-strain equations in an axisymmetric geometry, tracking the stress/strain evolution during boiler operation including outages at one-location along a boiler tube and compares it with scale damage criteria represented by Armitt diagram. The SPALLMAP code contains modules developed for oxide growth, stress analysis, and classical fracture mechanics correlations by taking into account the following phenomena and features, (a) Non-uniform thermal expansion coefficient of oxides and metal substrates, (b) Plant operation schedule with periodic alternate full-load and partial-load regimes, (c) axisymmetric formulation for cylindrical tubes, (d) Multiple oxide layers, (e) oxide-growth induced stresses, and (f) damage criteria from classical fracture mechanics. The computer program is written in FORTRAN90. Its modular structure was sought for allowing the best flexibility in updating the program by implementing new constitutive equations due to availability of new material property data and/or new physical phenomena.",

Unlike existing algorithms that return the density of states as a numerical array, this algorithm avoids binning of a continuous variable and is able to express the density of states in an analytical form. It is thus suitable for the study of the statistical mechanics and thermodynamic properties of physical systems where the density of a continuous state variable is of interest. The new algorithm presented here is a special reweighting method in classical Monte Carlo approaches. In particular, it can be regarded as a descendant and a hybrid method closely related to the multicanonical method and Wang--Landau sampling.",

Job templates are Bash scripts with parameters substituting for host-specific PBS directives and controls.

The performance of our proposed approach was compared against a state of-the-art CNN and the commonly used SVM classifier.

    "description" : "A challenging scientific problem that will benefit from exascale computing is predictive simulation of two- and three-dimensional quantum many-body Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, together with the related strong entanglement problems in quantum chemistry and quantum computing. Efficient numerical simulations will require new insights into wavefunction compression algorithms that scale on extremely heterogeneous HPC architectures. To address this need, we propose to develop a scalable math library of parallel multi-linear algebraic numerical primitives for hierarchical tensor compression. Our library will subsequently be used for building an efficient, performance-portable HPC framework for simulating strongly correlated quantum systems. In particular, our will will be the first to deliver a massively parallel implementation of the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a hierarchical tensor decomposition quantum scheme capable of expressing local expectation values of strongly entangled higher-dimensional quantum systems efficiently. To address the extreme complexity and high computational cost of such schemes, we will automate their parallel implementation by delivering an integrated software framework, ExaTN (Exascale Tensor Networks), that will process hierarchical tensor representations on exascale HPC systems via an asymchronous task-based programming model. As a specific application, our framework will provide scientists with a capability of simulating strongly entangled quantum systems, thus positioning ORNL as a strategic leader in modeling of strongly correlated materials.",

    "description" : "The software \"eeyore\" solves the problem of running Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms on Bayesian neural networks. There is software for MCMC algorithms and software for neural network (such as PyTorch and TensorFlow), but there are limited solutions for combining the two. The main idea is to create a subclass of the 'torch.nn.Module' for defining Bayesian neural networks with the desired functionality required by MCMC taking the form of additional methods in that sub-class. This way, neural network functionality of PyTorch is exposed to the developer and user, allowing to develop MCMC methods on top of it through a simple API. The code implements Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms and population MCMC algorithms, as well as combinations of these, for Bayesian neural networks. This kind of functionality is not available elsewhere, to the best of the authors' knowledge. Moreover, a simple API is available that allows to implement new MCMC algorithms in the future.",

First, the just-in-time (JIT) compilation strategy produces optimally tuned CUDA C++ kernels due to the data layout being perfectly known at runtime and compiled via calls from the Python interpreter. NAMSA automatically optimizes the 2-D FFT planning, and CUDA multi-streams scheduling/launching of probe simulations. With NAMSA, we can simulate electron scattering/microscopy on hundreds to thousands of GPUs, while removing the major limitations of memory and bandwidth from MSA.",

This generates a list of candidate metabolites. The list contains both false positive and ambiguous identifications. The software tool (the invention) takes the list of candidate metabolites, generated from NMRbased metabolite identification, and then calculates, for each of the candidate metabolites, the monoisotopic mass-tocharge (m/z) ratios for each commonly observed ion, fragment and adduct feature. These are then used to assign m/z ratios in experimental ESI-MS spectra of the same sample. Detection of the signals of a given metabolite in both NMR and MS spectra resolves the ambiguities, and therefore, significantly improves the confidence of the identification.",

Developing a simple and efficient open-source code simulation tool is important for boosting the optimization and evaluation of such device in HVAC community. This paper reports a first-order physics based model which accounts for the fundamental heat and mass transfer of humid-air vapor at feed side to flow stream at permeate side. The current model comprises two membrane mass transfer submodels (i.e. microstructure model and performance map model); and it adopts a segment-by-segment methodology for discretizing heat and mass transfer governing equations. The model is capable of simulating both dehumidifiers and energy recovery ventilators with parallel-flow cross-flow, and counter-flow configurations. The model was validated with the measurements at appropriate device. The practices in dehumidification and energy recovery exchangers are also discussed. The model and open-source codes are expected to become a solid fundament for developing a more comprehensive and accurate membrane-based dehumidification in the future. ",

    "description" : "JPype is a Python module to provide full access to Java from within Python. It allows Python to make use of Java only libraries, exploring and visualization of Java structures, development and testing of Java libraries, scientific computing, and much more. By gaining the best of both worlds using Python for rapid prototyping and Java for strong typed production code, JPype provides a powerful environment for engineering and code development. This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as Jython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native level in both virtual machines. This shared memory based approach achieves decent computing performance, while providing the access to the entirety of CPython and Java libraries.",

    "description" : "Compilers transform program source code to machine executable code. During this transformation, they perform a number of compiler optimizations to improve the performance of the generated executable\ncode. Importantly, applying those optimizations depends on the source code structure, such as the parallel programming model used to\nparallelize an algorithm. Often, implementations of the same algorithm with different programming models have vastly different performance because the compiler optimized them differently. We create FAROS, a framework to structure and automate the analysis of compiler optimizations on programs. FAROS automates the building process, execution profiling, and analysis of compiler optimization of programs, through a configuration interface. It outputs compiler optimization reports to show which\noptimizations applied to which line of source code, leveraging compilation remarks output by the compiler. Also, FAROS supports\nbenchmarking performance of different program versions by collecting execution time results. In this first release of FAROS, we provide a configuration file to analyze compiler optimization differences for sequential vs OpenMP compilation, including 38 programs consisting of HPC proxy/mini/large applications, and NAS and Rodina kernels for analysis.

    "description" : "The Electricity Markets Investment Suite Approximate Equilibrium (EMIS-AE) package is developed at NREL and provides a solution capability to solve generation expansion equilibrium problems in the electricity markets. EMIS-AE is designed to capture the evolution of the electricity generation portfolio resulting from the interactions of heterogeneous investors under different policy and market designs. The investment problem for each generation company (GENCO) is a bi-level problem with the investment decision made in the upper level and market clearing condition in the lower level, which traditionally is represented as a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraint (MPEC). EMIS-AE provides a predictive model to be trained for estimating the system-wide revenues for each technology type across energy, ancillary services and capacity markets given the amount of installed capacity on the grid. The profit maximization investment problem for each GENCO is solved using a global search algorithm, which uses the predictive model to evaluate the objective function. To solve for the strategic equilibrium, each GENCO鈥檚 problem is plugged into a diagonalization algorithm that is generally used in multi-leader, single-follower bi-level problems.",

    "description" : "TestSNAP is a stand-alone prototype of the SNAP force kernel used in the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code.  It contains synthetic input data (neighbor atom positions) and reference output data (forces on atoms) for several different SNAP models.  The prototype performs the force calculation repeatedly, checking the results against the reference data. At the end it reports the grind time [msec/atomstep] and RMS force error [eV/A].  This allows performance experts to quickly test new hardware and software strategies, obtain a realistic performance estimate and verify that the computation was performed correctly.

It allows for the treatment of finite or infinite lossy, coated wires and lossy grounds. This capability, in conjunction with the ability to treat the cases of wire above ground, resting on the ground, and buried beneath the ground, makes ATLOG general and a complete tool for the analysis of this problem. The ATLOG program is offered as an alternative option to a full-wave solution, as opposed to a replacement method. It is our experience that this type of faster-running tool is extremely useful to quickly assess a wide variety of scenarios and determine relative impact over a wide parameter space. In addition, this type of tool may be of value because it does not necessarily require an expert user and, combined with other toolsets, can be used in an operator-mode for damage assessment.

    "description" : "The Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator is a SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit simulator. It has been designed to use distributed memory parallelism to address the scalability issues inherent to solving large nonlinear DAEs. Xyce supports the standard analysis capabilities found in other analog circuit simulation codes, such as DC, transient, AC, and small-signal noise analyses, and also has less common capabilities, such as harmonic balance and sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty propagation techniques. Xyce supports industry-standard compact models via its Verilog-A model compiler. Foundry process-development kits (PDKs) are supported via the XDM netlist translator, which is included as part of the Xyce code base. A focus of Xyce development has been to provide scalable, numerically accurate analog simulation for large-scale circuits through the development and improvement of the algorithms at the core of SPICE-style simulation.

    "description" : "A Matlab-based computational model line code has been developed for predicting the performance of fluid-powered longitudinal piston modules and motors. A system of equations has been developed based upon applying the conservation of mass to a control volume defined by a reciprocating piston. The method results in a differential equation that predicts the pressure gradient in the control volume as a function of rotor rotation angle. The model uses an integration scheme to predict the pressure state in the control volume. The orifice equation is used to predict the flowrate in and out of the control volume. From the resulting solution the torque and speed characteristics of the motor configuration can be predicted, optimized, or tailored for a specific requirement.SAND2019-13983 M\n\nSandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy鈥檚 National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525.",

These methods are often used for unsupervised machine learning to find significant properties of sparse, unstructured data sets.  GentenMPI uses the same algorithms that are available in Sandia's open-source codes TensorToolbox and Genten, but GentenMPI provides distributed memory implementations of these algorithms using infrastructure from Sandia's open-source Trilinos framework.  GentenMPI includes an implementation CP-ALS (canonical polyadic decomposition via alternating least squares optimization, first published in 1970 by Carroll & Chang and Harshman); its distributed memory implementation uses Trilinos' Map-based distribution of data to processors and Trilinos' communication operations designed for sparse matrix-vector multiplication.  Its performance is comparable to other open-source CP-ALS implementations (e.g., the SPLATT tool of Smith and Karypis).  GentenMPI also include a distributed memory implementation of GCP-SGD (generalized canonical polyadic decomposition via stochastic gradient descent, first published in 2019 by Hong, Kolda and Deursch); the implementation closely follows that in TensorToolbox, and exploits a block-based data distribution to perform sampling in parallel.

    "description" : "WeightedAFL (WAFL) is an improvement to open source fuzzer, American Fuzzy Lop (AFL). Fuzzers modify input to target programs in order to produce crashes and other unintended output in those target programs. WAFL integrates directly with AFL to determine offsets within a buffer that will improve performance metrics. WAFL uses various machine learning techniques to learn these offsets. WAFL also provides a novel software engineering solution to integrate with AFL and allows contributors to quickly write and test algorithms in python.

    "description" : "Reduced-order Models (ROMs). ROMs are \"compressed\" approximations of high-fidelity computational models. Implementing ROM methods in production codes is typically intrusive, i.e. the native codes must be adapted and modified, with individual ROM methods reimplemented in every application code. This clearly constitutes an obstacle to users who want to use ROMs.\nTo address this, we have developed Pressio, which is a C++ header-only ROM library that can be used by an application code in a non-intrusive fashion. The main objectives behind the design of Pressio are: (a) support for general computational models (data structures, PDE types); (b) heterogeneous hardware (CPU, GPU); (c) performance; and (d) extensibility.\nUsing metaprogramming techniques, Pressio detects and leverages the application?s native linear algebra data structures (e.g. vector and matrix) to run the ROM methods. The application only needs to expose the velocity vector and Jacobian matrix via an adapter class. Pressio checks at compile time that the target application meets the correct API. The library is structured in several modular packages including (a) non-linear least-square solvers (e.g. Gauss-Newton with and without line-search); (b) singular value decomposition (for the computation of the ROM generalized coordinates) and (c) algebraic hyper-reduction.SAND2019-5878 M\n",

    "description" : "The J-integral vs. crack growth resistance curve (J-R curve) is a useful tool for evaluating material fracture toughness in the ductile condition. A widely accepted practice for conducting tests to obtain J-R curves is ASTM standard E1820, in which the normalization method was introduced as an alternative method for determining the J-R curve. The normalization method requires solely force-displacement data, together with initial and final crack size measurements from a specimen to derive the J-R curve. Because of the elimination of the compliance measurement, the normalization method significantly simplifies testing requirements to obtain J-R curve. Despite these advantages, the analysis procedures of the normalization method are quite complicated to follow, which may limit the wide application of this method. To address this, we have developed a software with user-friendly graphic interface to perform automated normalization analysis. Any users, even without detailed knowledge of the normalization analysis, can use this software to derive J-R curves based on the ASTM E1820 normalization method.",

Even though there exist many data science and machine learning tools, they are not intuitive for many traditional scientists who are not familiar with programming. ASCENDS provides easy and intuitive interfaces (command-line interface, graphical user interface) to users so they can use data science capabilities without having to understand programming language. ASCENDS performs data visualization, machine learning model training, storing and prediction (regression problem), automatic hyperparameter tuning, and supports various machine learning models including random forest, kernel ridge, nearest neighbor, neural network, etc. Users can use standard CSV (comma separated values) format data set and investigate the feature columns that are highly correlated to a target column; further, they can learn ML models, then store and use them for predictions. The tool is supposed to be generically applicable so that it can be used for many different applications.",
